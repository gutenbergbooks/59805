<h2 id="hdr_1">DECEPTIONS: A MATRIMONIAL STUDY</h2>
</div>

<p class="credit">(Italian of Haydée: Translated for Short Stories by E. Cavazza.)</p>

<p>When, before the altar, the priest asked her, “are you content?”
it was with all her soul Gemma had responded, “Yes!”</p>

<p>Oh, yes; she was content indeed. Through the cloud of
costly lace which enwrapped her in its snowy transparence,
she saw the vast church all dotted with lights, resplendent in
the dark gleam of mosaics upon golden backgrounds, animated
by the slight movement of the very elegant crowd that
filled it; lighted by oblique rays descending from the nave,
all a glitter of gold, silks and brilliants; and it was her own
future that she seemed to see thus—the years of luxury and
wealth which her rich marriage was preparing for her. And
had it not been the dream for which she sighed? She, the
ideal blonde, of eighteen years, with the tall and proud figure;
the pure, disdainful profile under heavy curls like those of an
archangel; with haughty eyes sparkling like blue gems
under the golden fringes of her long eyelashes.</p>

<p>She had been for a long time a poor girl, the daughter of
citizens who had seen better days, that marvelous human
lily. She had experienced all the petty troubles, all the cruel
daily sufferings of misery that conceals itself. The poor and
inelegant gowns, painfully remodeled every year; the insolence
of creditors; humiliations; continual and tormenting
thoughts of money—she had experienced them all, and in her
little heart, eager for pleasure and enjoyment, swollen with
unsatisfied longings, a dream was arisen little by little, occupying
all the room, rendering her insensible to all the rest:
the dream of at last becoming rich.</p>

<p>She wanted it, absolutely; she was born for it; she was
rich, now. That “yes,” which she had just pronounced,
had, by its three magic letters, changed her destiny; and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
was so content, so happy, that it appeared to her it was all a
dream, that her Mechlin veil was a cloud that transported her
into the realms of the impossible, across a sidereal heaven,
of which the diamond pins thrust among her laces formed the
flaming stars; and, in order to return to reality, she must
cast her eyes toward her husband, Luigo Marchis, kneeling
beside her, in the mystic, velvety shade of the altar, lit by
the tremulous brightness of the candles.</p>

<p>Ah, there was nothing ideal about him, poor fellow! In
vain he straightened his correct person of an elegant man,
with his accurately shaven face, with slender brown moustaches,
and a still fresh color that gave him something the
look of an actor; he remained none the less old, with his
powerful shoulders a little bent, with his eyelids grown heavy,
and crow’s feet toward his temples, with the gray locks that
appeared here and there among his brown hair, with his forty-seven
years, of which the weariness was more conspicuous
beside that radiant and blonde Spring.</p>

<p>Forty-seven years! How was it possible? He felt his
heart so palpitating, full of tears as in youth! And he could
not comprehend how so much time had passed, he could not
persuade himself of the incredible fact—forty-seven years
passed without knowing Gemma.</p>

<p>For they had been acquainted with each other only two
months. Marchis, however much he had frequented society,
drawn there by his banking connections, had never let himself
be talked to of marriage. What! A wife, children,
troubles, cares, disappointments ... not even by idea!</p>

<p>And at forty-seven years, one evening, present from
motives of curiosity at a ball to which the employees of his
bank had invited him, he must needs be smitten by the
exquisite, vaporous grace of that blonde girl, dressed simply
in white, entering on the arm of a funny little man with a
baby-face and a big, silvery beard, her father, a modest clerk
in the bank, a rather ridiculous little old man who, beside
that divine apparition, slender in her robes of snow, made one
think of the gnomes of folk-tales, always crouching at the
feet of the fairies.</p>

<p>Ah, weakness of hearts growing old! That apparition was
enough to shake all the ideas of Luigo Marchis concerning
matrimony, and as the old gnome, despite his absolute nullity,
was an honest citizen, incapable of resisting the assiduities of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
the Director to his pretty daughter, the suitor had been
greatly pleased with the consent of that little maiden of
eighteen, that beautiful creature, that blonde being, to become
his wife. Now he trembled with joy; his eyes were misty
with vivid emotion—not perceiving that that too was a sign
of old age—and it was a voice choked with joy that to the
question of the priest, “Are you content?” replied: “Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>Now, it is done. United, forever united. Having arisen
to their feet, she with an elegant and light impulse, like a
lily, wind-lifted on its stem; he with a little effort and
difficulty, wearied by emotion, they go down from the altar
arm-in-arm. Now they pass through the church amid the
murmurs of compliments which arise amid the shadows of the
aisles, among the dull scraping of feet and the rustle of
gowns; there on the peristyle, among the white columns, is a
living wave of sun and air which comes to meet them, like a
recall to real life, outside of the mystic dream of the church,
the creaking of the line of carriages that advanced, the slow
descent of the steps, with the white train of the bride spreading
and dragging upon the stairs, in folds like snow, soft and
light; then the carriages depart; they are alone for the first
time, in the narrow space of the carriage, which the bridal
dress fills with its whiteness, and the bouquet of orange-blossoms
with its acute perfume of intoxicating virginity; and it
is then that, conquered by the charm of that face, so delicate
and proud amid its large pallid curls, by the splendor of those
blue eyes, the elderly bridegroom bends over her to kiss <span class="locked">her—</span></p>

<p>“Dear me, dear me....”</p>

<p>And to see the tranquility with which those finely cut, rose-colored
lips return the kisses, through the veil, the question
arises whether it is the bridegroom that she kisses, or the
Mechlin lace, at five hundred the metre.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Ah! there were adorers around that beautiful signora
Marchis, so lovely and so young, married to an old man! It
was expected that this fortress would be an easy one to
conquer. Precisely on her wedding day, Vico Molise, the
most elegant and skeptical of the journalists of Upper Italy,
had propounded to his friends this theorem:</p>

<p>“Given a beautiful girl, very poor; given that she marries
a rich old man; divide the number of his years by that of
the hundreds of thousands of lire of which she becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
mistress, and you will have the number of months necessary
for her to take a lover.”</p>

<p>And as soon as he could, he began, with many others, to
attempt the demonstration of that theorem.</p>

<p>Well, this time the impeccable psychological diagnosis of
Vico Molise had been found to fail. Not only, after some
months, the beautiful signora Marchis had no lover, but it
appeared also that she never was to have one.</p>

<p>Always dressed with an adorable elegance, with a luxury
full of good taste, the beautiful Gemma loved to amuse herself,
moving freely in that society new for her, finding herself
in her right place as a marvelous plant in a vase of valuable
porcelain, developing itself in all its splendor. She went to
dances, to the theatre, enjoying the plebiscite of admiration
provoked by her beauty, coquetting a little with her adorers,
fluttering about the fire in order to make them sparkle, her
wings of a golden butterfly; but never letting herself be burned.</p>

<p>In the very moment of a declaration, in the midst of one of
those waltzes whose notes seem made on purpose to stifle
expiring virtue in their serpentine spirals, she cut short her
adorer by turning her angelic head, and saying serenely:</p>

<p>“I don’t see my husband.... Look a little where my husband
is, if you will be so kind.”</p>

<p>And it was known that her greatest delight was to relate,
precisely to her husband, the declarations which she had
received. When she came home with him from a ball, all
wrapped in the white silken folds of her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sortie du bal</i>, with her
pure throat, her snowy shoulders that blossomed still more
fair from her swansdown boa; when in the evening she met
him in the dining-room, still in visiting costume, with her slim
waist tightly compressed by an exquisitely elegant gown, with
her face animated by the slight excitement which elegant
conversation always produces in a young woman, she amused
herself immensely in addressing to her husband some of these
provoking and roguish phrases:</p>

<p>“You know, I was at Countess Foschis’.... Molise was
there, you know.... Always faithful and always in despair....
And also Comelli, he that has such lugubrious gallantry....
He has promised to kill himself for my sake, within
a month, we shall see.... Ah! Ah!”</p>

<p>And sitting opposite to him, in a rustle of satin and jet,
making shine like two stars the brilliants, large as hazelnuts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
which adorned her small ears, she continued to laugh, with
her elastic laughter, full of mischief and full of tenderness.</p>

<p>Ah, indeed, old Marchis could call himself a fortunate man!</p>

<p>Fortunate? Yes, he ought to have considered himself so.
When he set himself to reason about it, to describe mentally
his conjugal situation, he had to conclude that he would have
done wrong to complain of his destiny. And yet....</p>

<p>What of the terribly unexpected had he now discovered in
the depths of the pure sapphire of Gemma’s eyes? Was there
arisen in his soul the doubt that that faithfulness against every
trial, that coldness toward her admirers was nothing but the
wish to preserve intact a position acquired with difficulty, and
that precisely to that position was directed all the tenderness
shown toward himself! I do not know; but the vivid and
impetuous joy of the wedding was no longer in him, although
his love remained the same; and a painful doubt thrilled in
his voice when he replied to the playful confidence of Gemma,
forcing himself to laugh too:</p>

<p>“Take care, now, take care.... The vengeance of the
tyrant hangs over you....”</p>

<p>Ah, the poor tyrant, how he loved her! How she had
known how to bind him with her little hands, white and perfumed
as two lilies. For nothing in the world would he have
discovered the truth, changed into certainty his fomenting
doubt; so, she had only to ask in order to obtain; for now
for him that love of which he doubted, had become his life;
and he felt a painful stricture at his heart at the mere thought
that a day might come when he would be obliged to refuse
her something. Yet that day came. Suddenly, by one of
those mysterious complications of business his bank, which
until then had gone from triumph to triumph, underwent a
violent shock. Not a noisy downfall, one of those open,
public ruins, which produce great failures; but one of those
deep, intimate secret crises, that must be borne without a
word, a lament, under penalty of death; that can be overcome
only by force of small privations, little hidden savings;
it is then that strict economy in the family becomes necessary.
The luxury of Gemma, in those moments, became absolutely
ruinous for her husband; he ought to have warned her, sought
to check her; he dared not; and continued to content her,
but very soon came the time when he could do so no more.</p>

<p>It was on the occasion of a great ball to which she was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
go; she had ordered from Paris a marvelous gown that became
her to perfection; still she was not satisfied. Some days
before, in the showcase of the most fashionable jeweler of the
city, a diadem had set in revolution all the feminine imaginations;
a superb jewel, of antique style, set in silver gilt, of a
starry pallor, where the brilliants seemed drops of flame.
Gemma wished to have it and indeed it would be difficult to
find a face adapted to the almost religious richness of that
jewel, more than her snowy profile of an angel in ecstacy.</p>

<p>Ten thousand francs was the price of that jewel; and
Marchis did not have them. Mute, immovable, his heart
oppressed, he listened to Gemma’s words as she described it
to him. How could he tell her, how could he even tell her
that he had not the ten thousand francs. It was terrible.
To another woman who should have had that caprice, one
might have proposed to have her own diamonds reset after
that model or perhaps even to have an imitation diadem
made; no one would have suspected it; but he felt that the
danger lay in confessing his powerlessness. Yet, it must be
done.... And he made an effort at courage.</p>

<p>Gemma had seated herself beside him, throwing back and
bending a little to one side her blonde head, with that irresistible
feminine movement which displays the white throat, the
pure line descending from the slender neck to the full-bloomed
bust down to the round and flexible waist.</p>

<p>“I would like to have it, it seems to me that I should look
well.... Don’t you think so? I have a great wish to be
beautiful.... If you knew why?”</p>

<p>She laughed, now, deliciously, with the air of her roguish
hours. He was silent for a moment; then, fixing a vague
look upon the delicate designs of the oriental carpet, paling
as if from an inward wound, he murmured:</p>

<p>“The fact is that I do not know.... I do not really know
whether ... whether I shall be able to buy it for you....”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>She had quickly raised her head, much surprised, uneasy,
looking at him. Such a thing had never happened to her.</p>

<p>Marchis wiped his forehead and resumed his discourse.</p>

<p>“The fact is ... you see, in a bank like ours, there are
moments that ... certain moments in which one cannot ...
in which it is impossible.”</p>

<p>What was impossible for him, in that moment, was to finish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
the phrase. He stopped, and lifted his eyes timidly to her,
desolately, as if to beg her to help him. She was very pale,
with a sudden hardness in all her features, in her compressed
mouth, in her knit brows, in her sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Have you not ten thousand francs? Is it possible?”</p>

<p>And her voice was hard as her look ... a profound hardness
that startled him. But all at once her face changed
expression, she recovered her fresh, tuneful laugh, the sweet
and limpid ray was rekindled in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Come you want to tell me stories, so as not to buy me
anything.... Deceiver! I that wished to be beautiful in order
to drive Vico Molise a little crazy; he has declared to me
that he is tired of my perfidy.... See, you deserve.... Do
you know that I am becoming angry with you?”</p>

<p>She really believed that she had hit the truth, with her
words. Indeed, he had so well kept up the illusion with her,
he had hidden so jealously his embarrassment, that she did
not know how to explain this sudden restriction. But meanwhile,
every word of hers was a blow to the heart of Marchis;
he saw her already at the ball, passing from arm to arm with
her step like a flying angel; listening to the insidious compliments
of Vico Molise and his kind, and keeping meantime
in her heart that leaven of rancor against him because of his
refusal; and he saw himself again, as he had seen himself a
little while before in the mirror, old, weary, worn, beside her
so fresh, young, with eyes sparkling from the cruel scorn of
one who has made an unequal bargain.</p>

<p>Suddenly he rose, like one who has taken a decision, passed
his hand across his brow, and without replying, went away to
go out of the house. She believed that she had conquered,
and let him go without moving herself, only with a flash of
cunning in her eyes; but when he was on the stairs the door
opened, a blonde head appeared between the folding-doors—</p>

<p>“We are agreed, then?”</p>

<p>He did not reply; and she heard his step down the stairway,
slow, heavy, weary.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The evening of the ball, Marchis knocked at the door of
his wife’s dressing-room. “Come in,” and he entered.</p>

<p>In the little dressing-room so illumined as to seem on fire,
with the air filled with fragrance from the little unstoppered
bottle of perfume, all gleaming white with the disorder of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
feminine apparel scattered about, Gemma stood erect before
the mirror, between two kneeling maids, ready dressed for
the ball. She was truly radiant in her gown of white satin
with almond blossoms, with fresh sprays of almond flowers
around the neck of the dress, at the waist, among the waving
folds of the train, issuing from that covering of delicate, pale,
dawn-tinted flowers, she too was fresh as they, with her
faintly rosy complexion, as if she were one of those flowers
become a person. But under her lashes gleamed anon the
flash of cold and cruel rancor.</p>

<p>Her husband had not given her the diadem!</p>

<p>But hearing him enter, she turned, and seeing that he held
a casket in his hands, she comprehended everything. With a
bound, she was beside him, her arms twined around his neck.</p>

<p>“Oh, how good you are! How good you are! How I love
you!” He trembled all over, and was very pale. Gemma
did not even perceive it. All at once, with one of her irresistible
movements, she loosened her arms from his neck, took
with one hand the casket and with the other holding her
husband’s hand, she led him after her to the mirror. She
seated herself and opened the casket. Among puffs of red
plush, under the burning light, the diadem sent forth sparks
like a flame. She had a new outburst of joy, took the husband’s
head between her hands, drew it down, and kissed
his forehead—oh! the forehead of a corpse, icy and livid;
then without looking at his features, his wandering gaze, she
offered him the diadem and bent before him her blonde head,
which was so well suited to that mystical jewel.</p>

<p>“Come sir, crown me!”</p>

<p>And while he sought to unite with trembling hands the
clasp of the gems among those marvelous blonde curls, waving
and breaking into ripples of gold at every movement, she,
still with bent head, lifted her smiling eyes to meet his look.
And he answered with a resigned gentleness to the smile of
those perilous blue eyes; he, the poor man who deceived for
the sake of desire to be deceived, and who bought for himself
a little mock love with ... mock diamonds.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_2">ETCHINGS: FROZEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="credit">(E. Henderson: For Short Stories.)</p>

<p>A bleak afternoon in Dakota ... a sledge containing two
women and several men is driven rapidly across the prairie.</p>

<p>Alighting at a “shanty,” the women and one of the men
enter. The rest of the men immediately begin digging, or
rather “chopping” a grave in the frozen ground. They
work silently and unceasingly, by turns, for the short winter
afternoon already shows signs of merging into night.</p>

<p>The three that entered the house are standing, nervously
looking on the scene before them. A fireless stove, unmade
beds, everything desolate and untidy. In the middle of the
room, a table; on it a motionless form, covered with a coarse
gray blanket; on the bed a much smaller, shrouded, form.</p>

<p>One of the women advances to the table, and summoning all
her fortitude, throws aside the blanket, and looks on the face
of the frozen woman ... frozen solid as a block of ice, the
clenched hands, filled with fine, dry snow, fine as sand, sifted
into every tress of hair, into her eyes, her ears, down into her
bosom, that lay bare, showing how she had tried to nourish
her babe, in the face of that pitiless storm ... what availed the
warmest mother love, against that relentless cold ... frozen
with the blood still in her cheeks and lips ... no time for the
crimson stream of life to leave the face.</p>

<p>Bare and comfortless as their home was, no one knows
what tempted them to leave it that terrible day. They were
bound for a neighbor’s house half a mile distant but had not
gone quarter the way when they turned in the wrong direction.
They struggled on, husband and wife, carrying the babe less
than a year old, until the woman could go no further, and
throwing up her hands, fell down. Laying the now stiffening
form of the child beside its mother, the bewildered father
wandered on, on, until he reached by chance, miles distant,
a place to incoherently tell his story and—perish.</p>

<p>The family belonged to the poor “dumb driven cattle” class
of Russian Jews. Their own kind had left them to their fate.
So the settlers had turned out to give them Christian burial.
When the desolate funeral was over the party drove rapidly
home again, with the picture before them, of what might be
their own fate, if night overtook them on the prairies.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_3">A DEPUTY GOVERNOR’S WOOING</h2>
</div>

<p class="credit">(French of Andre Theuriet: Isabel Smithson: For Short Stories.)</p>

<p>“Can you receive Madame Blouet, sir?” asked an attendant,
as he opened the door of the deputy governor’s office.</p>

<p>It was a large, severe-looking apartment, with a very high
ceiling, two windows draped with green damask curtains,
walls and arm-chairs of the same color, and heavy bookcases
of mahogany. The highly waxed floor reflected the
cold symmetry of the official furniture, and the mirror over
the mantel-piece reproduced with exactness a black marble
clock, two bronze lamps and a pair of gilt candlesticks.</p>

<p>Hubert Boinville, the deputy governor, was seated, with
his back to the fire-place, at a large mahogany desk which
was littered over with deeds and various papers. He raised
his grave, melancholy face which was framed in a brown
beard, tinged with a few gray hairs, and his black eyes, with
tired-looking lids, glanced at the card which the solemn usher
handed to him.</p>

<p>On this card was written in a trembling hand, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Veuve Blouet</i>
(widow Blouet), but the name conveyed no information to
him and he put it down impatiently.</p>

<p>“It is an old lady, sir,” said the attendant, in explanation,
“shall I send her away?”</p>

<p>“No, let her come in,” replied the deputy governor in a
tone of resignation.</p>

<p>The usher straightened himself up in his uniform, bowed,
and disappeared, returning the next minute to show in the
visitor, who stopped on the threshold and dropped an old-fashioned
courtesy.</p>

<p>Hubert Boinville half rose from his chair, and with cold
politeness signed her to a seat, which she took, after making
another courtesy.</p>

<p>She was a little old lady, dressed in shabby mourning.
Her black merino gown had a greenish tinge, and was wrinkled
and darned; a limp crape veil, which had evidently served
through more than one period of mourning, hung down on
each side from an old-fashioned bonnet, and beneath a front
of false brown hair was a round, wrinkled face with bright
little eyes, a small mouth, and no teeth.</p>

<p>“Sir,” she began, in a somewhat breathless voice, “I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
the daughter, sister and widow, of men who served their
country. I applied some time ago to the Department for
help, and I have come to see whether there is any hope.”</p>

<p>The deputy governor listened without moving a muscle of
his face. He had heard so many supplications of this kind!</p>

<p>“Have you ever received any assistance!” he asked, coldly.
“No, sir,” she replied. “I have managed to get on until
now without asking. I have a small pension.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he interrupted in a dry tone, “in that case I am
afraid we can do nothing for you. We have a great many
applicants who have no pension to rely upon.”</p>

<p>“Ah, listen, sir!” she cried despairingly, “I have not
explained everything. I had three sons and they are all
dead. The last one taught mathematics, and one day during
the winter, when he was going from the Pantheon to Chaptal
College he caught a violent cold which settled on his lungs
and carried him off in two weeks. He had supported me
and his child by teaching; the expenses of his illness and
death used up all our little savings, and I had to raise money
on my pension. Now I am alone in the world with my grandchild,
and we have nothing. I am eighty-two years old, sir.”</p>

<p>Tears had gathered under her wrinkled eyelids as she spoke,
and the deputy governor was listening more attentively than
he had done at first. A peculiar singing intonation of the
speaker’s voice, and the sound of certain provincial expressions
seemed to his ears like once familiar music; the old
lady’s way of speaking had for him a flavor of home which
produced a most singular sensation in his mind. He rang
his bell and sent for Madame Blouet’s “papers,” and when
the sedate usher had laid a thin package before him, he
examined the yellow pages with evident interest.</p>

<p>“You are from Lorraine, I see, Madame,” he said at last,
turning toward her a face less stern, and on which a faint
smile was seen, “I suspected it from your accent.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir, I am from Argonne,” she answered, “and you
recognized my accent! I thought I had long singe lost it—I
have been knocking about France like a flying camp.”</p>

<p>The deputy governor looked with increasing compassion at
this poor widow whom a harsh wind had torn from her native
forest, and cast into Paris like a withered leaf. He felt his
official heart growing softer, and smiling again, he said:</p>

<p>“I also am from Argonne. I lived near your village for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
long time, at Clermont,” and then he added gaily, “keep up
your courage, Madame Blouet, I hope we shall be able to
help you. Will you give me your address?”</p>

<p>“Number 12, Rue de la Sante, near the Capuchin convent.
Thank you, Sir, for your kindness. I am very glad to
have found a fellow countryman,” and after repeated courtesies
the widow took her departure.</p>

<p>As soon as she was gone M. Boinville rose, and going to
the window stood looking down into the garden with his face
against the glass. But he was not looking at the tops of the
half leafless chestnut trees; his dreamy gaze wandered far
off toward the East, beyond the plains and the chalky hills
of Champagne, past a large forest, to a valley where a quiet
river flowed between two rows of poplar trees, to a little old
town with tile-roofed houses. There his early childhood had
been passed, and later, his vacations. His father, who was
registrar in the office of the Chief Justice, led a narrow, monotonous
life, and he himself was early accustomed to hard
work and strict discipline. He had left home when in
his twenty-first year and had returned only to attend his
father’s funeral. Possessing a superior intellect and an iron
will, and being an indefatigable worker he had risen rapidly
on the official ladder, and at thirty-eight years of age was
made deputy governor. Austere, punctual, reserved, and
coldly polite, he arrived at his office every morning at exactly
ten o’clock and remained there until six, taking work with
him when he went home. Although he was possessed of
keen sensibilities, his bearing was so reserved and undemonstrative
that he was thought cold and stern; he saw very little
of society, his life being devoted to business, and he had
never had enough leisure to think of marrying. His heart
indeed, had once asserted itself, before he had left home, but
as he then had neither position nor fortune, the girl he loved
had refused him in order to marry a rich tradesman. This
early disappointment had left in Hubert Boinville a feeling of
bitterness which even the other successes of his life could not
wholly efface, and there was still a tinge of melancholy in his
being. The old lady’s voice and accent had recalled the
thought of the past, and his quiet was overwhelmed by a
flood of recollections. While he stood there motionless, with
his forehead pressing against the window-pane, he was stirring,
as one would a heap of dead leaves, the long slumbering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
memories of his youth, and like a sweet delicate perfume,
rose the thoughts of by-gone scenes and days.</p>

<p>Suddenly he returned to his chair, drew Madame Blouet’s
petition to him, and wrote upon it the words, <em>very deserving
case</em>. Then he rang his bell, and sent the document to the
clerk in charge of the relief fund.</p>

<p>On the day of the official assent to Madame Blouet’s petition,
Mr. Boinville left his office earlier than usual, for the
idea had occurred to him, to announce the good news himself
to his aged countrywoman.</p>

<p>Three hundred francs. The sum was but a drop in the
enormous reservoir of the ministerial fund, but to the poor
widow it would be as a beneficent dew!</p>

<p>Although it was December, the weather was mild, so Hubert
Boinville walked all the way to the Rue de la Sante, and
by the time he reached his destination, that lonely neighborhood
was wrapped in gloom. By the light of a gas lamp
near the Capuchin convent, he saw “Number 12” over a
half-open door in a rough stone wall, and on entering, found
himself in a large market garden. He could just distinguish
in the darkness, square plots of vegetables, some groups of
rose bushes and here and there the silhouettes of fruit trees.
At the other end of the garden, two or three dim lights
showed the front of a plain, square building, and to this the
deputy governor made his way and had the good luck to run
against the gardener, who directed him to the widow Blouet’s
lodgings upstairs. After twice stumbling on the muddy steps,
M. Boinville knocked at a door under which a line of light
was to be seen, and great was his surprise when, the door
being opened, he saw before him a girl of about twenty years,
holding up a lighted lamp and looking at him with astonished
eyes. She was dressed in black, and had a fair, fresh face,
and the lamp light was shining on her wavy chestnut hair,
round dimpled cheeks, smiling mouth, and limpid blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Is this where Madame Blouet lives?” asked M. Boinville
after a moment’s hesitation, and the girl replied, “Yes, sir.
Be kind enough to walk in. Grandmother, here is a gentleman
who wants to see you.”</p>

<p>“I am coming,” cried a thin, piping voice from the next
room, and the next minute the old lady came trotting out,
with her false front all awry under her black cap, and trying
to untie the strings of a blue apron which she wore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
“Holy mother!” she cried in amazement on recognizing
the deputy governor, “is it possible, sir? Excuse my appearance,
I was not expecting the honor of a visit from you.
Claudette, give M. Boinville a chair. This is my grandchild,
sir. She is all I have in the world.”</p>

<p>The gentleman seated himself in an antique arm-chair
covered with Utrecht velvet, and cast a rapid glance round
the room, which evidently served as both parlor and dining-room.
It contained very little furniture; a small stove of
white delft-ware, next to which stood an old-fashioned oaken
clothes-press; a round table covered with oil-cloth and some
rush-bottom chairs, while on the wall hung two old colored
lithographs. Everything was very neat, and the place had
an old-time air of comfort and rusticity. M. Boinville
explained the object of his visit in a few words, and the
widow exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, sir! How good you are. It is quite
true that pleasant surprises never come singly; my grandchild
has passed an examination in telegraphy, and while she
is waiting for a position she is doing a little painting for one
and another. Only to-day she has been paid for a large
order, and so we made up our minds,” said the grandmother,
“to celebrate the event by having only old home dishes for
dinner. The gardener down stairs gave us a cabbage, some
turnips and potatoes to make a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">potée</i>; we bought a Lorraine
sausage, and when you came in I had just made a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tôt-fait</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tôt-fait</i>!” cried Boinville. “That is a sort of cake
made of eggs, milk and farina; it is twenty years since I
heard its name and more than that since I tasted it.”</p>

<p>His face became strangely animated, and the young girl,
who was watching him curiously, saw a look of actual greediness
in his brown eyes. While he was lost in a reverie of the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tôt-fait</i>, Claudette and her grandmother turned away and
began discussing, and at last the girl whispered:</p>

<p>“I am afraid it would not do.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” returned the old lady, “I think it would
please him.” And then, seeing that he was looking at them
wonderingly, she went toward him, saying:</p>

<p>“M. Boinville, you have already been so kind to us that
I am going to ask of you another favor. It is late, and you
have a long way to go—we should be so glad if you would
stay here and taste our <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tôt-fait</i>—should we not, Claudette?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
“Certainly,” said the girl, “but M. Boinville will have a
plain dinner, and besides, he is, no doubt, expected at home.”</p>

<p>“No one is waiting for me,” answered the gentleman,
thinking of his usual dull, solitary meals in the restaurant.
“I have no engagement, but—” he hesitated, looked at
Claudette’s smiling eyes, and suddenly <span class="locked">exclaimed:—</span></p>

<p>“I accept, with pleasure.”</p>

<p>“That is right!” said the old lady, briskly. “What did I
tell you, Claudette? Quick, my pet, set the table and run
for the wine, while I go back to my <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tôt-fait</i>.”</p>

<p>The girl had already opened the press and taken out a
striped table-cloth and three napkins, and in the twinkling of
an eye the table was ready. Then she lighted a candle and
went down stairs to fetch the wine, while the old dame sat
down with her lap full of chestnuts, which she proceeded to
crack and place upon the stove.</p>

<p>“Is not that a bright, lively girl?” she said, “she is my
consolation; she cheers me like a linnet on an old roof.”</p>

<p>Here the speaker rattled the chestnuts on the stove, and
then Claudette reappeared, a little flushed and out of breath,
and the old woman went and brought in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">potée</i> and set it
steaming and fragrant on the table.</p>

<p>Seated between the cheery octogenarian and the artless,
smiling girl, and in the midst of half-rural surroundings
which constantly recalled the memory of his youth, Hubert
Boinville, the deputy governor, did honor to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">potée</i>. His
grave, cold manner thawed out rapidly and he conversed
familiarly with his new friends, returning the gay sallies of
Claudette and shouting with merriment at the sound of the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">patois</i> words and phrases which the old lady used.</p>

<p>From time to time the widow would rise and go to attend
to her cookery, and at last she returned triumphant, bringing
in an iron baking-dish in which rose the gently swelling
golden-brown <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tôt-fait</i>, smelling of orange-flower water.</p>

<p>Then came the roasted chestnuts in their brown, crisped
shells, and the old lady brought from her press a bottle of
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fignolette</i>, a liquor made of brandy and sweet wine.</p>

<p>When Claudette had cleared the table, the grandmother
took up her knitting mechanically and sat near the stove,
chatting gaily at first, but she now yielded to the combined
effects of the warmth and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fignolette</i> and fell asleep.
Claudette put the lamp on the table, and she and the visitor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
were left to entertain each other. The girl, sprightly and
light-hearted, did nearly all the talking. She had been
brought up at Argonne, and described the neighborhood with
such exactness that Boinville seemed to be carried back to
his native place; as the room was warm Claudette had opened
a window, and the fresh air came in laden with the odors of
the market-garden, and the gurgling sound of a fountain,
while farther off was heard the bell of the Capuchin convent.</p>

<p>Hubert Boinville had an hallucination, for which the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fignolette</i>, and the blue eyes of his young countrywoman were
responsible. It seemed as if twenty years had rolled backward
and that he was still in his native village. The wind
in the fruit trees was the rustling of the Argonne forest, the
soft murmur of running water was the caressing voice of the
river Aire. His youth, which for twenty years had been
buried under old papers and deeds was now revived, and
before him were the blue laughing eyes of Claudette, looking
at him so artlessly that his long torpid heart awoke suddenly
and beat a delightful pit-a-pat against his breast.</p>

<p>Suddenly the old lady awoke with a start and stammered
an apology. M. Boinville rose, for it was time to go, and
after thanking the widow warmly for her hospitality and
promising to come again, he extended his hand to Claudette.
Their eyes met, and the deputy governor’s glance was so
earnest that the young girl’s eyelids drooped suddenly. She
accompanied him down stairs, and when they reached the
house door he clasped her hand again, but without knowing
what to say to her. And yet his heart was full.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Hubert Boinville continued to give, as is said in official
language, “active and brilliant impulse to the Department.”
The ministerial machine went on heaping up on his desk the
daily grist of reports and papers, and the sittings of the
Council, audiences, commissions and other official duties kept
him so busy that he could not find a spare hour in which to
go to the humble lodgings near the Capuchin convent. In
the midst of his work, however, his thoughts often wandered
back to the humble little dinner, and several times his attention
was distracted from an official document by a vision of
Claudette’s bright azure eyes, which seemed to flutter about
on the paper like a pair of blue butterflies. When he returned
to his gloomy bachelor apartment, those eyes went before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
him, and seemed to laugh merrily as he stirred his dull fire,
and then he thought again of the dinner in the cheerful
room, of the fire blazing up gaily in the delft stove, and of
the young girl’s merry prattle, which had temporarily resuscitated
the sensation of his twenty-first year. More than
once he went to his mirror and looked gloomily at his gray-streaked
beard, thought of his loveless youth, and of his
increasing years, and said with La Fontaine:</p>

<p>“Have I passed the time for loving?”</p>

<p>Then he would be seized with a sort of tender homesickness
which filled him with dismay, and made him regret that
he had never married.</p>

<p>One cloudy afternoon toward the end of December, the
solemn usher opened the door and announced:</p>

<p>“Madame Blouet, sir.”</p>

<p>Boinville rose eagerly to greet his visitor, and inquired, with
a slight blush, for her granddaughter.</p>

<p>“She is very well, sir,” was the answer, “and your visit
brought her luck; she received an appointment yesterday in
a telegraph office. I could not think of leaving Paris without
again thanking you, sir, for your kindness to us.”</p>

<p>Boinville’s heart sank.</p>

<p>“You are to leave Paris; is this position in the provinces?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in the Vosges. Of course I shall go with Claudette;
I am eighty years old, and cannot have much longer to live;
we shall never part, in this world.”</p>

<p>“Do you go soon?”</p>

<p>“In January. Good-bye, sir; you have been very kind to
us, and Claudette begged me to thank you in her name.”</p>

<p>The deputy governor was thunderstruck, and answered only
in monosyllables, and when the good woman had left him
he sat motionless for a long time with his head in his hands.</p>

<p>That night he slept badly, and the next day was very
taciturn with his employes.</p>

<p>Toward three o’clock he brushed his hat, left the office,
and jumped into a cab that was passing, and half an hour
later he hurried through the market garden of Number 12,
Rue de la Santé, and knocked tremblingly at Madame Blouet’s
door. Claudette answered the knock, and on seeing the deputy
governor, she started and blushed.</p>

<p>“Grandmother is out,” she said, “but she will soon be
home and will be so glad to see you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
“I have come to see, not your grandmother, but yourself,
Mademoiselle Claudette,” he returned.</p>

<p>“Me?” she exclaimed anxiously, and he repeated, “Yes,
you,” in an abrupt tone, and then his throat seemed to close
and he could hardly speak.</p>

<p>“You are going away next month?” he asked at last.</p>

<p>The girl nodded assent.</p>

<p>“Are you not sorry to leave Paris?”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed I am. It grieves me to think of it, but then,
this position is a fortune to us, and grandmother will be able
to live in peace for the rest of her days.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I should offer you the means of remaining in
Paris, at the same time assuring comfort to Madame Blouet?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!” exclaimed the young girl, her face brightening.</p>

<p>“It is rather a violent remedy,” he said, hesitating again,
“perhaps you would think it too great an effort.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, I am very resolute—only tell me what it is.”</p>

<p>He took a long breath, and then said quietly, almost harshly,</p>

<p>“Will you marry me?”</p>

<p>“Heaven!” she gasped, in a voice of deep emotion; but
although her face expressed the deepest surprise, there was
no sign of repugnance or alarm. Her bosom heaved, her lips
parted, and her eyes became moist with tender brightness.</p>

<p>Boinville dared not look at her, lest he should read refusal
in her face, but at last, alarmed by her long silence, he
raised his head, saying, “You think me too old—you are
frightened—”</p>

<p>“Not frightened,” she answered, simply, “but surprised,
and—glad. It is too good. I can hardly believe it.”</p>

<p>“My darling!” he cried, taking both her hands “you
must believe it. I am the one to be glad, for I love you.”</p>

<p>She was silent, but there was no mistaking the tenderness
and gratitude that were shining in her eyes, and Hubert
Boinville must have read them aright, for he drew her closely
to him, and meeting with no resistance, raised her hands to
his lips and kissed them with youthful fervor.</p>

<p>“Holy Mother!” cried the old lady, appearing on the
scene at that instant, and the others turned round, he a little
confused; the girl blushing, but radiant.</p>

<p>“Do not be shocked, Madame Blouet,” said the deputy
governor. “The evening that I dined here I found a wife; the
ceremony will take place next month—with your permission.”</p>

<h2 id="hdr_4">ETCHINGS: THE SAD HOUR</h2>
</div>

<p class="credit">(H. A. Grace: For Short Stories.)</p>

<p>A florist-shop in the city of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>A lady, apparently about thirty years of age, dressed somberly
in black, enters, and approaching the proprietor, who
is behind the counter, demurely asks:</p>

<p>“Does anyone ever use those floral pieces that I see in
the window, as wedding presents?”—at the same time indicating
by a gesture that she referred to mementoes of immortelles
there conspicuously displayed.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered the florist, somewhat astonished, “that
is a use to which I have never before heard of their being
put; still I know of no reason why they could not be so used,
if one desired to give such an emblem as a token of esteem at
such a time. What design would you think of using?” setting
on the counter such emblems as Gates Ajar, a harp, and a lyre.</p>

<p>“I hardly know,” continued the lady, “still, I think possibly
this one might answer,” picking up the lyre.</p>

<p>“What inscription would you wish on it?” asked the florist.</p>

<p>“The sad hour.”</p>

<p>“Is not that rather sombre for such a joyous occasion?”</p>

<p>“Well, it might be ordinarily, but the fact is simply this:
the gentleman to whom I wish to send it and myself were
engaged to be married, and he is now about to marry another
lady; so if you think the immortelles that you put in it
will last a long time, I will take this lyre, and have the <span class="locked">motto—</span></p>

<p class="p2 b2 center wspace larger"><span class="bbox">THE SAD HOUR</span></p>

<p class="in0">—just as large and prominent as ever you can make it.”</p>

<p>To this the polite florist replies that he had no doubt but
that the immortelles would last as long as could be desired.</p>

<p>The lady left, composed and satisfied.</p>

<p>The emblem was finished in strict accordance with the
order and promptly delivered to the address given.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_5">ABRUM, CA’LINE AND ASPHALT</h2>
</div>

<p class="credit">(W. N. Harben: The Round Table.)</p>

<p>Upon the church, the negro denizens of Crippletown
focused their opinions. They were about equally divided
between the Methodist and Baptist denominations, and no
matter how much sociability existed among the men as they
went to work together, or among the women as they chatted
or sang over their wash-tubs, when Sunday came with its
suggestive clangor of church bells, friendliness drew itself
into its shell of finery, and only protruded its head to cast
depreciative glances at members of any church save its own.</p>

<p>Squads of people bound for the Baptist church, passed
squads of people bound for the Methodist church without
exchanging even nods of greeting. Extreme reserve and solemnity
characterized the general religious bearing.</p>

<p>It is Sunday evening in the cottage of Abraham Wilson, a
most devout Methodist of the blackest physical type. He
had talked Methodism to his young wife until her brain and
tongue were in a tangle. He made it the theme of his
evening and morning discourses, and threw in foot-notes at
all possible opportunities. He, as well as his neighbors, were
curious to know which denomination Caroline would finally
join, especially as it had been whispered for some time that
she was “on the fence” owing to the fact that her parents
had been Baptists and her husband a Methodist.</p>

<p>Few doubted that Abraham’s powers of argument would in
time bring her wavering mind to his views. But it seemed
that Caroline’s besetting sin, vanity, and love of display,
linked with the persuasive powers of the Baptist minister,
who called on her often through the day while Abraham was
away, were to bulwark the latter’s earnest endeavors.</p>

<p>She had ever looked with charmed eyes on the baptismal
ceremonies, which usually took place in a neighboring creek,
and her heart had suffered frequent pangs at thinking
that she was hindered from being the cynosure of the thousands
that sung and shouted on the shore as the dripping
candidates were led from the stream. From childhood up
she had looked forward to immersion with as much anticipation
as she had to marriage. Regardless of this she had
married a Methodist, because she had loved him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
“Abrum,” said she, after listening to him in silence for
an hour, “Abrum, I know you think you is right, en ev’ybody
kin hat der own way er thinkin’ ’bout chu’ches, but
ez fur me, I know I’s hat my min’ set on ’mersion in runnin’
water ev’y since I know my min’. I’s been puttin’ it off frum
summer ter summer, en now you gwine to disagree wid me.”</p>

<p>Abraham’s surprise rendered him almost speechless. He
had felt intuitively that Caroline did not agree with him for
a long time, but had nursed the belief that his arguments
would wear away her objections ere she gave them voice.</p>

<p>“You ever let me yer er you gwine wadin’ in ’at creek en I
swear ’fo’ God I’ll trash you ev’y step frum deh home.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” his wife grunted defiantly. “Shuh, Abrum Wilson!
you ain’t man enough; your feared to tech me. I don’t
want none er yo’ ol’ ’ligion. ’Sides anything ’at’s good ’nough
for Jesus Christ certney is good ’nough fer me. De bible
seh He went down into de water; now, Abrum, I can’t go
down into de water en hat de preacher des sprinkle my haid
out’n er gravy bowl, same as I does w’en I’s ironin’. Now
w’t’s de use in talkin’ dat way. Whyn’t Christ des ax um
fer er lil in er goa’d dipper? Seem lak dat enough ’cordin’
ter yo all’s way.”</p>

<p>Abraham had exhausted every argument in his brain
already, so he could formulate no reply, but inflated almost
to explosion with turbulent spleen, he resumed his seat in the
door, while she, momentarily triumphant, bustled round the
cottage to put their only child, little Asphalt, to bed. The
latter two-year old innocent owed its name to the fact that
he happened to be born one day while Abram was employed
in laying asphalt pavement in the city. He was struck with
the high-sounding name and told Caroline that the mixture
had “des enough pitch in it fer er nigger child’s name.”</p>

<p>When she had put Asphalt to bed, Caroline timidly drew
her chair near to his. He did not look at her.</p>

<p>“Now, Abrum,” said she, pacifically, “you is hat yo’ way, en
I hain’t seh nothin’ ergin it all ’long sence we is married.” She
waited a moment for him to speak, but as he was stubbornly
silent she went on with growing firmness, as she slily eyed
him askance: “I ’low ter jine de Baptist chu’ch, de Lawd
willin’, en git my ’mersion ’long wid Sallie en Lindy. Brer
Brown was here yistiddy en I done give ’im my promise; an he
give me lessons w’en ter hol’ my bref ter keep from stranglin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
Abraham turned upon her with such suddenness that she
shrank back into her chair as if smitten.</p>

<p>“You seh you is hehn? You seh you is?” he growled.
“Well, we gwine see. You seh you is gwine wade out in dat
creek lak er crippled duck. Le’ me des see it en I’ll git er
divo’ce sho en never put my foot in dis house ergin.</p>

<p>“You go git yo’ divo’ce,” she said sullenly, “I’s got er right
ter my side same ez you.”</p>

<p>“Look yer, Ca’line!” he snapped out, rising clumsily to
his feet, “you des seh ernurr word en I’ll pick up dat plank
deh en ’fo’ God I’ll split it over yo’ haid. Huh!”</p>

<p>He waited a moment for the silenced woman to speak, but
she did not answer him in words. She angered him more
than ever by stealthily regarding him from the corner of her
eye and humming, with as much gusto as her caution would
allow, a hymn that was usually sung by the Baptists during
their baptismal ceremonies.</p>

<p>To this Abraham had no reply, save to look at the offender
as if he would thus scorch her with the volcanic heat of his
supreme contempt, and walked away into the darkness.</p>

<p>Caroline’s song dwindled into a murmur as he vanished.
She went to the door and peered after him as he receded in
the misty moonlight, with a look of deep concern upon her.</p>

<p>Abraham went on until he came to the cottage of his
widowed sister, Martha Todd. Here he took a seat on the
doorstep. A woman came out of the unlighted room.</p>

<p>“Dat you, Abrum?” she grunted in surprise. “Well, well;
I do know you skeered me, sho, kase I ain’t ’spectin’ you.
What kin er happen ter tek you off frum home dis time er
night; I des fixin’ ter go ter baid?”</p>

<p>“Marfy,” said the visitor, in a deeply pained voice, “de
storm has riz in my own home at las’. I reckon me en Ca’line
done bust up fer good.”</p>

<p>“Why, Abrum; whut’s de matter? How come you seh
dat? My!”</p>

<p>“Sister Marfy, you know Ca’line. You know how she is
w’en she set ’er haid. She is sho’ nough set on ’mersion en
de Baptist chu’ch. You know how I is on dat subjec’.”</p>

<p>“Brer Abrum, dis done come on us at las’.” The woman
seemed to filter her tones through a mixture of resignation and
satisfaction. “I been hat my eye open fer er long time. I
ain’t seh nothin’ kase it no business er mine, en I ’low it bes’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
ter wait. Ev’y day while you hard at wuk de Baptist preacher
is been er buzzin’ in Ca’line’s ear. I don’t see no way out’n
it. It sholly is too bad; Asphy is so young; you is sech er
big Mephodis’ an’ er deacon, too. I do know how you feel.”</p>

<p>“Marfy,” said the ebon devotee, sternly, as he evoked a
dull thud from his knee onto which his broad hand descended;
“Marfy, me en Ca’line gwine be divo’ced, ’at’s de end.”</p>

<p>“Too bad she tuk dat way,” sighed Martha Todd, more
deeply than she was given to over her own misfortunes.</p>

<p>The truth was that nothing could have pleased the
widowed and childless woman more than to have her brother,
who was such a prominent Methodist, and a steady laborer, a
member of her own household, which would be, she knew, in
case of a separation between the couple.</p>

<p>“Women is er caution, sho, brer,” she went on, “I do know
Ca’line is haid-strong. Mighty bad fer bofe, dis disagreement.
’Tain’t ’cordin’ ter scriptur’.”</p>

<p>Silence fell upon the pair, save for the sound of Martha’s
breath as it contended with the nicotine in her uncleanly pipe-stem.
The hours passed until the clock within struck twelve
jingling strokes. Abraham rose stiffly, lingered, stretched himself,
for he felt that he needed to apologize for going back.</p>

<p>“Yer gwine back ter ’er, brer?” Martha Todd asked significantly.
“May de Lo’d be ’long wid you den.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go er step, but I hatter git my clothes frum
’er’,” said he sheepishly. “You reckon I gwine ’low dat gal
ter keep my clothes? Huh! Marfy, w’at you rekon I is?”</p>

<p>“Once you git back she gwine ’suade you ter let ’er be
’mersed. Who knows, we may see Deacon Abrum wid wet
clothes on, too. Some women is too sly——”</p>

<p>“You go ’long, sister, I tell you too much is done pass
twixt me en Ca’line. I des gwine atter my things, den I’ll
come live wid you—I’ll be yer in de mornin’.”</p>

<p>Thus speaking, Abraham turned slowly homeward. Late
as it was he found Caroline sitting in the door smoking her
pipe. She had a sulky mien on her bent, portly form. She
drew her feet under her chair as her liege lord passed wordless
into the cottage. He turned up the wick of the low-burning
lamp, and as its feeble rays struggled through the
room his glance fell on the features of sleeping Asphalt, and
a lump rose in his throat.</p>

<p>A crude wardrobe stood against the wall. Through its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
open door he caught a glimpse of his clothing crowded into
the piece of furniture with Caroline’s finery. Therein was
his long-tailed broadcloth coat, his bell-shaped silk hat, his
shining doeskin trousers, and an overcoat.</p>

<p>He had magnanimously made up his mind that he would
demand nothing of the domestic wreck except his own clothing.
The furniture of the cottage, all other belongings of
him and his wife, should remain with her, even little Asphalt.</p>

<p>While he was looking under the child’s bed for his best
boots, which he remembered casting off there a few hours
previous, Caroline, with a meaning smile playing round her
lips, as if she had divined his plans, rose automatically,
walked with a well-assumed air of sleepiness to the wardrobe,
and locking it, put the key in her pocket. Then, as if
unaware that his startled orbs were on her, she went to the
clock on the mantelpiece and began to wind it, singing the
while a little air which she often sung when wholly at ease
with herself and all the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Abraham stood behind her rigid form, boots in hand, in
silence. Something in Caroline’s prompt flank movement
gave him a thrill of vague pleasure, while it aroused his
aggressiveness. She had thwarted him, it was true, but in
doing so had of her own will raised a hindrance to his quitting
the place. Abraham had a struggle with himself. Somehow
the room seemed to be more cozy than ever before,
while Martha Todd’s house rose bleak and dreary before
his mental sight. How amicably all might be arranged if
Caroline would only relinquish her dream of “runnin’ water.”</p>

<p>Then it occurred to him that, in justice to his usual sternness
of manner, he must say something hard to her, must
force the key of the wardrobe from her, and secure his clothing,
but he could not do it; he was softened by her quiet
mien as she stood in the door and looked out at the night.
But if he did not take his clothing to his sister in the morning
what excuse could he offer for having failed so ignominiously?
He decided that he would wait until the next day
and see what could be done; so he went into the adjoining
room, the “guest-room,” and retired.</p>

<p>He lay in bed with his eyes open, reflecting over the ridiculous
position Caroline had placed him in before his fellow
churchmen, and smarting over the knowledge that the Baptists
were enjoying his discomfiture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
After a while the lamp was extinguished in Caroline’s room,
and by her snoring he knew that she was sound asleep. He
knew that it would be an easy matter for him to steal into
her room and take the wardrobe key from her gown pocket
and get possession of his guarded property, but he shrank
from hastening matters in any such way. After a while he
slept and snored in harmony with his estranged wife.</p>

<p>When he awoke in the morning a most tempting breakfast
was waiting him on the table, and Caroline and little Asphalt
were looking neat and interesting. He took his accustomed
seat glumly and ate his breakfast with a good relish. His
pride prevented him from speaking to the woman from whom
he was to be divorced, though it did not in any wise interfere
with his partaking of the food she had cooked before he was
awake. By his wounded taciturnity he would have her comprehend
that his day in the cottage was over, that he only
delayed to get a chance to lessen the overpacked wardrobe.</p>

<p>So far, it was true, he had made little headway, but then
Rome was not built in a day, and he could afford to abide
his time, especially as the immersion season had not yet
arrived. But he remembered, with a chill, that on his way to
work that morning he would be obliged to pass Martha
Todd’s house. She would be expecting him to bring along
an armful of clothing. What could he do to excuse his delay?
He bethought himself all at once of his Sunday boots and the
blacking and blacking-brush, still under Asphalt’s little bed.
With them he could pay an installment on his sister’s hopes
and also shield himself from the appearance of defeat.</p>

<p>Rising from the table, he reached under the bed, and
securing the articles in question he tucked them under his
arm and sailed forth without looking at Caroline or Asphalt.</p>

<p>Martha Todd was on the lookout, pacing up and down her
front yard. She vanquished a rather open look of curiosity
as he sauntered down the sidewalk, and gave her face an
expression of absolute vacancy of thought.</p>

<p>“Good mornin’, Abrum?” said she.</p>

<p>“Good-mornin’, sister,” he replied, in a sigh, as he passed
her into the cottage, “kin I ax yer ter save dese yer boots en
blackin’-bresh fer me. It’s all my things I kin git my han’s
on now. Ca’line is de beatenes’ woman in dis wull I do
know. She’s locked um all up in de wa’drobe en hid de key
som’rs. But I gwine back ter night en watch my chances.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
She ’low she mighty sharp, but you gwine see. You gwine
hear supin drap; now min’ whut I seh. She hatter git up
’fo’ day to haid me off. De minute I git my han’s on any er
my things I gwine fetch um right ter you, en w’en I got um
all frum ’er she kin des go, now you min’ whut I seh. She
kin des go ’long en wade en swim tell she tek er tail lak er
tadpole fer all I keer. All I want is whut b’longs ter me. I
gwine hat um, too, en not many words be passed nurr.”</p>

<p>Discerning Martha began to place a small value on her
prospect of gaining her point, but in the sweet delight of
being a partner in a family disagreement she did not make
her fears known, and pretended to think that he was in the
right to a final separation from Caroline.</p>

<p>That day Abraham’s companions wondered at his moods.
He was very absent-minded, and seemed extremely nervous
and ill at ease. As the hour for dinner arrived he remembered
that he would be obliged to go home for a small piece
of plug tobacco which he had forgotten.</p>

<p>“My lord, Abrum!” exclaimed a dusky companion in
surprise, “whyn’t you step er crost ter de sto’ en buy a piece.
It’s er mile, en’ll push you lak smoke ter git back.”</p>

<p>“No use,” said Abraham, taking his luncheon in his hands
and eating it as he started off. “No use; I des got ter hat
it. It’s my sweet navy, en deh ain’t non er dat kin’ in dat
sto’. I cay’nt do er lick dis evenin’ less’n I got it.”</p>

<p>He found it necessary to avoid passing in view of Martha
Todd’s house, so his distance was a trifle longer than usual.</p>

<p>He stood in the door in surprise. Caroline and Asphalt
were seated at the dining table, and on it for that midday
repast was only some bread and water. His heart smote him
suddenly as he remembered what a delightful luncheon she
had always put up in his pail of mornings. But he must not
weaken. He remembered that the desired piece of tobacco
was in the pocket of a pair of trousers now locked in the
wardrobe. Notwithstanding this knowledge, he went to
the mantelpiece, looked in the clock, turned over papers, and
ran his hands over the covering of Asphalt’s bed.</p>

<p>Then feeling that some explanation was due Caroline, who
was regarding him surreptitiously, he said to Asphalt, whose
lack of comprehension was as positive as his blackness:</p>

<p>“Asphy, honey, has you seed yo’ papa’s piece er terbaccer?
Seem lak I lef’ it in my blue check pants.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
Caroline, however, as if taking the remark to herself, without
deigning to look at him, went to the wardrobe, unlocked
it, and threw the pair of trousers referred to on the bed, and
placidly resumed her work over the fire-place.</p>

<p>With marked eagerness Abraham ran his hand into a pocket
of the garment, and finding the tobacco, he forthwith partook
of a quid, as if he were unable to stay his desire for another
moment. Then he stood and gazed at his wife steadily for a
minute with a mingled look of embarrassment and resentment.</p>

<p>But she took not the slightest notice of him. She did not
move save to reach over and fan the flies from Asphalt’s face.</p>

<p>Abraham was in hasty argument with himself in regard to
the disposal of the trousers lying before him. He did not
like to take them away, for he would be obliged to go to
Martha Todd’s house to leave them in her care. If the
trousers had been his best he might have thought differently,
but as fate would have it they were of the very least value of
any of his clothes. They were adorned with vari-colored
patches, and fringed badly at the knees.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Caroline, he feared, would consider his
failing to take them as an evidence that he was weakening
from the rigorous course he was pursuing toward a divorce.
He decided upon an exhibition of contempt for the trousers,
and again brought his child into diplomatic service.</p>

<p>“Asphy,” said he ruefully, holding the trousers out at
arm’s length, while the child was most desperately chewing
his cheek to dislocate the colony of flies from the Oklahoma
below a wildly rolling orb, “Asphy, yo’ papa has certney got
all de use out’n dese yer pants. Some tramp kin hat um.
’Sides I mus’ git er lots er new things ter wear in Texas.”
With those words, the last of which caused Caroline to start,
he threw the trousers into a corner and left the cottage.</p>

<p>As night after night passed the breach seemed to be widening
between the couple. Morning after morning Abraham
emerged from his house bearing some article of clothing he
had managed to secure. He took them to Martha Todd.
She smiled, and shed some crocodile tears over the coat, vest,
or trousers, as the case might be, cast depreciating looks at
certain grease spots or rents, with a sigh that too plainly
suggested her opinion of Caroline’s domestic negligence.</p>

<p>One night while Abraham was sedulously searching under
the beds, behind trunks, and everywhere for something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
belonging to him, he was deeply surprised to detect a loud
grunt, indicating a burthen of both defiance and disgust, in
the bosom of his hitherto wordless wife. He was even more
surprised to see her go with a hasty shuffle to the wardrobe
and show him that it had not been locked by throwing the
door of it wide open.</p>

<p>With another most contemptuous grunt she resumed her
seat and began to pat her foot on the floor vigorously, as if
to vent her boiling spleen.</p>

<p>Abraham felt cold to his very marrow. She was then
willing to remove every hinderance to his leaving, had, indeed,
made an opening by which he could hasten his departure.</p>

<p>He approached the wardrobe slowly, casting helpless glances
at Caroline’s heaving back. There among her gowns hung
naught he could call his own save a soiled linen duster and
his overcoat. With trembling fingers he took the duster from
its hook, and stalked out into the night. Slowly he glided
with bowed head toward his sister’s house. She sat in the
doorway behind a cloud of tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he almost in a whisper, “well, Marfy, dis
trouble is mos’ over wid now. ’Twon’t be long ’fo’ I’ll come,
now. I think I got de las’ thing ’cep’ er overcoat. Wid good
luck I think I kin git dat ter-morrer night. Ter-night I hope
you’ll ’low me ter sleep in yo’ company-room. I want ter let
Ca’line en Asphy git use’n ter stayin’ in dat house alone.”</p>

<p>Martha rose and moved into the adjoining room to arrange
his bed. Her movements betrayed high elation. Things
had taken a shape at last that she had hardly hoped for. She
lay awake until past midnight listening to Abraham’s creaking
bedstead and gloating over the prospective triumph over
her heretical sister-in-law.</p>

<p>The next morning Abraham ate his breakfast at Martha’s
and went to work without going home. He thought that an
additional twelve hours to Caroline’s suspense would do much
toward showing her how desirable it was to have a man around
the house. The ensuing day, be it said, was a long one to
him, and he suffered more than he thought she did.</p>

<p>When he slouched into his cottage at dusk that day, he was
shocked to see the inevitable wardrobe open. Indeed the
door of that receptacle was frowningly held ajar by means of
a stick of stovewood.</p>

<p>Abraham, however, had arranged a grand <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup d’ etat</i> for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
this last visit to his home. It remained to be seen how the
enemy would receive the movement.</p>

<p>It was Saturday. He had his entire earnings of the week—twelve
silver dollars—in his pocket. He wondered whether
twenty-four halves or twelve whole dollars would make the
biggest display, and had finally decided on the latter.</p>

<p>Drawing his hand from his pocket to scratch his head he
contrived to evoke quite a merry jingle of coin as he stepped
across the room to a small table. Caroline’s face flushed and
she followed his movements with a mien of deep interest.
Not since their marriage had he failed to divide his week’s
wages with her. He did not, as she feared, hand it to her on
this momentous occasion. Instead, he sat down at the table,
after he had dusted and carefully rolled up his overcoat in a
newspaper and began to arrange his money in divers piles
and positions by the light of a small piece of candle which he
had taken from his pocket and lighted to show Caroline that
he was not obliged to call for the lamp, which shone on the
supper table.</p>

<p>Then he drew forth a soiled piece of writing paper, a small
stub of a pencil, and seemed to be engrossed in a deep calculation,
as he scratched down some strange hieroglyphics and
lines, as if they marked out his course in the future.</p>

<p>“Asphy,” said he, dreamily, the better to assume utter
unconsciousness of the fact that the child was asleep on its
bed. “Asphy, honey, you ain’t never yer anybody seh how
fur ’tis ter Texas, has you? De boss ’low it’s er long way
off frum Atlanta, but I reckon I kin git deh—de train starts
at twelve ter-night.”</p>

<p>Caroline was so excited that her trembling hands made
the dishes in the cupboard rattle as she was putting away the
supper, which he had refused to touch, although she had kept
it waiting for his arrival. She took a seat in the doorway
and turned her dusky face out toward the night in order that
he might not see her tear-dimmed eyes.</p>

<p>At the table he sat over his coin chessmen and figures until
the far-away strokes of a clock-bell rang the hour of ten out
to them from the heart of the sleeping city. As if to answer
the bell came a rasping, labored cough from slumbering
Asphalt, a disconnected jargon murmured as from a breast of
pain, half subdued by sleep.</p>

<p>Two pairs of eyes were raised suddenly; one from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
coin-strewn table, the other from the long rows of lights which
mark out a street on the blackness far away, between long
lines of tall buildings. Two hearts quickened their beatings
simultaneously. Two minds were focused on one idea.</p>

<p>The mother rose quickly and with a cat-like tread went to
the child and bent over him. Abraham all at once had eyes
for aught besides his gains. His mouth relaxed from its
drawn sternness and fell open as he watched Caroline’s anxious
posture at the bed. He went to her side.</p>

<p>They looked like a pair of ebony statues. The light of
the lamp and candle seemed to be struggling to produce
shadows of the couple on the wall, but the rays of one lessened
the power of the other, so that four dim contortions in shade
took the place of two. The mother’s hand was on the brow
of the sleeper; her breath was held in suspense.</p>

<p>“Ca’line,” more in a rasping gasp was the name pronounced
than in Abraham’s usual tones; “Ca’line, dat child has got
’is feet wet somewhar’. Dis typhoid fever is all roun’ dis
settlement en pow’ful bad wid chillun. You look atter him
honey; I gwine fur er doctor. I’ll be back ez soon ez I kin
git yer.” He left his money on the table, without giving it
a thought or glance, and darted hurriedly from the room.</p>

<p>Day after day the troubled pair watched over their sick
child, hoping and praying for its life to be spared to them.</p>

<p>“Ef it had en’ er been fur dis yer divo’ce we hat up ’twix
us, Ca’line, it wouldn’t er come, I know,” said Abraham, in
sackcloth and ashes one night. “It’s mighty bad ter tamper
wid whut de Lo’d have done jined tergerr, en all ’bout His
Own Son, too; better not hat no chu’ches en dat. Sister
done gwine sen’ me my things back.”</p>

<p>Caroline was husky of voice when she replied, dampening
a towel to cool Asphalt’s hot brow: “Abrum, I’m willin’,
en only too willin’ ter go wid you in yo’ chu’ch. I don’t
know no diffunce ’twix de two; I des hat my min’ sot on
foolish showin’ off. En if God will only spar dis one child,
I’ll never open my mouf ergin. Who knows but er gwine in
der water wid wet clothes might er been my regular death?
Mebby dis spell er Asphy’s is er warnin’ ergin it.”</p>

<p>Slowly Asphalt passed the dread climax, and began to grow
better, and to-day Crippletown does not contain a more
happy couple than Abraham and Caroline.</p>

<p>It is deep winter. A fierce storm shakes the windows in their
casement. Melting flakes were in his beard when he entered.</p>

<p>Within is no light save from the fire; a dull, steady glow
that bathes the room in soft rose. There are lordly furnishings;
about the floor great cushions; skins of the leopard and lion.</p>

<p>There is a screen.</p>

<p><em>My God, do not let me look behind that screen!</em></p>

<p>Hush! Where was I? Yes, on the furs before the fire, my
head, with loosened hair, pillowed on the rug at his feet.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to listen to the raging of the wind.</p>

<p>He had come to tell me of his approaching marriage—a
marriage of love, he said, and laughed.</p>

<p>It was then all the room seemed to burst into a firelight of
blood; all the sounds of hell rang in my ears; and my
wrist had the sudden strength of ten men to drive the blade
in his breast. His great muscles and firm flesh gave momentary
resistance to the point, and then, what joy to feel them
yield, and the steel slip deftly in!</p>

<p>The wet crimson poured over my fingers into the creases
of the palms he had kissed, and the dimples he had counted.</p>

<p>He rolled, so much clay, onto the white furs, and see, I
have drawn the screen in front of him ... for he is still
laughing ... the happy bridegroom.</p>

<p>I wish the bride might see that smile!</p>

<p>There is a dark stream crawling through the fur, meandering
and choosing its crooked way like a little brook in the
summer grasses, and it creeps on and on lazily toward the
polished hearth. It will run on until the flames drink it ...
and when it reaches them I must get some snow at the window
and wash my hands ... but just now I can think of
nothing but how long it will be by the tick of the carved
clock against the wall before it reaches its goal ... of nothing
but that, and how, when the fire sinks and crumbles to ashes
the waiting shadows will steal from the corners where they
hide and gather closer around me ... and I shall have to sit
motionless until the dawn, lest by chance I should set my
foot in that black little brook ... it is quiet ... but those
shadows are only waiting ... waiting in the corners!</p>

<h2 id="hdr_7">THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS FOUND</h2>
</div>

<p class="credit">(Edmond Spencer: Parisian Police Archives.)</p>

<p>M. Scipion Desruelles kept a small shop in the Rue de
Seine, Paris. He had a wife, but no children.</p>

<p>He was a small tradesman, and his wife a large, coarse-looking
woman, quite capable of taking care of shop and Scipion.</p>

<p>Scipion’s past life had been singularly uneventful.</p>

<p>One single circumstance had ruffled it, and that he used
often to relate to his gossips, in proof that a hero was spoiled
in the making when Scipion became a shopkeeper.</p>

<p>One night, ten years before the time of his introduction to
the reader, Scipion had gone to the theatre, and after the
performance had taken Madame to a restaurant and treated
her to a little supper. Returning home, after he was in bed
Scipion heard a noise in the shop. He armed himself with a
bootjack, went down, and, with the assistance of the hastily
summoned police, captured a burglar.</p>

<p>The man, who said he was an Italian, named Vedova, disclaimed
earnestly all felonious intentions, but could give no
good account of himself. Scipion prosecuted him vigorously,
and he was convicted and sent to Brest.</p>

<p>Two years later Scipion met Vedova in a café and had him
arrested as an escaped convict.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1852 Scipion received official notification
from Martinique that a bachelor cousin of his on the
island, whose name was Pache, was dead and had left him
heir to all his property which was large, and included a valuable
sugar plantation. Desruelles was further informed by
the notary at St. Jean, that it would be necessary for him to
come out in person and administer on the estate in order to
save himself great loss and inconvenience and many delays.</p>

<p>The bourgeois of Paris is not a traveling character, but
neither is he willing to lose money if he can help it. Scipion
bought himself a trunk, committed the little boutique in the
Rue de Seine to Madame’s charge—she was quite as competent
to take care of it as he—made a deed of all his property
in Paris to Madame as a preventive of accidents, and then
bidding her the most tender adieu, sailed for Martinique,
via Bourdeaux, in a brig which took out a cargo of claret
and oil for the French islands and New Orleans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
When Desruelles reached Martinique and went to St. Jean,
he was simply struck dumb to find his cousin alive and well,
and all the notarial papers he had received forgeries!</p>

<p>There was nothing for him to do but go back again.</p>

<p>The brig was to sail in a day for New Orleans, and Scipion
determined to go thither in her, take the cars to New York
and the steamer thence to Havre, in order to get home again
as speedily as possible. He was burning to send the police
in search of the rascals who had hoaxed him and made him
spend his money and suffer sea-sickness in a wild-goose chase.
He was armed with all the preliminary depositions and statements
necessary to open the case, duplicates of which were
to be forwarded by the authorities from Martinique.</p>

<p>Arrived in New Orleans, Scipion determined to spend a
day or two in the city before taking the cars for New York.
He put up at a boarding house in the French quarter, and
devoted himself to sight-seeing with great assiduity.</p>

<p>While at breakfast the second morning after his arrival he
was warmly greeted by a stranger, who took his hand and
said: “I am truly delighted to see you, Monsieur Quentineau!
When did you arrive?”</p>

<p>Scipion gently informed the man that he was not Quentineau,
but Scipion Desruelles.</p>

<p>The stranger with great violence said that the dodge
wouldn’t go down there! Next thing he’d want to repudiate
that bill of $725 he owed Marais &amp; Hughes.</p>

<p>Scipion said he had only been in the city a day, had never
seen the stranger before, nor knew he who or what Marais &amp;
Hughes were—consequently could not possibly owe them or
anybody else anything.</p>

<p>An hour later Scipion was arrested on a warrant taken
out by Marais &amp; Hughes, liquor dealers in Canal street, against
Pierre Quentineau, an absconding debtor.</p>

<p>Scipion Desruelles, alias Quentineau, was cast into prison.
He found a lawyer, and with great difficulty, and at the cost
of half his money, proved that he was not Quentineau, but
Scipion Desruelles, a passenger aboard the brig Braganza, of
Bordeaux. But for the captain he would have been convicted,
for several witnesses swore that he was Quentineau.</p>

<p>As soon as Scipion was released he went to the levee and
embarked on a steamer for Memphis, intending to make his
way thence by rail to New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
At Memphis he was misdirected, enticed into a low groggery
under the bluffs and robbed of every cent he had left.
Scipion found his way to the mayor of the city, who promised
to write to the French Consul at New Orleans about it and to
send the police in search of the thieves.</p>

<p>Scipion meantime wrote to Paris to Madame for a remittance,
and went about in search of a situation. A cotton
broker gave him some correspondence with Louisiana Creole
planters to look after, and he was thus enabled to earn
enough to eat. But no answer nor remittance came from
Madame, and our poor exile could not make money enough
to take him home. At last he wrote to his cousin in Martinique,
stating his circumstances, and received shortly after in
reply a draft for 2,500 francs.</p>

<p>Scipion immediately bought himself some clothes and necessaries,
took the cars and started for New York.</p>

<p>Here, while waiting for the sailing of the Havre steamer,
he was again arrested as being Pierre Quentineau a fugitive
from justice and a bond-forger.</p>

<p>By the merest good luck the cotton-broker in whose employ
he had been in Memphis happened to be in the city, and
Scipion was able to establish an alibi. His passport was
stolen from him on the Memphis steamer, and he had to get
another one in New York, being thus delayed a week.</p>

<p>Finally, to his intense joy, he was outside Sandy Hook on
his return voyage.</p>

<p>Arrived at Havre, he was accosted on the quay by a customs
officer with, “Eh bien! Monsieur Quentineau! What
have you to declare at <em>this</em> time?”</p>

<p>“Sacre bete de Quentineau!” cried the exasperated boutiquier;
“I am Scipion Desruelles, marchand, numero 79 <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bis</i>
rue de Seine.”</p>

<p>“Then, sir, you must be detained,” said the officer.</p>

<p>While he was waiting in the customs office a man came
behind him, slipped something in his hand, and whispered:
“Don’t be afraid, Quentineau! They have nothing whatever
against you! Here’s what I owe you!”</p>

<p>Desruelles turned quickly, but the man who had spoken to
him was already lost in the crowd, and Scipion found eight
gold Napoleons in his hand. Mechanically he put the money
in his pocket, cursing this Quentineau whom everybody persisted
in mistaking him for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
His baggage proving all right, and his passport not objectionable,
Scipion was after some delay permitted to start for
Paris, but still under the suspicion of the authorities that he
was not Desruelles, but Quentineau. At Rouen, in the railroad
restaurant, he changed a Napoleon to buy a bottle of
wine and half a chicken. As soon as he reached Paris he
took a fiacre and drove to numero 79 Rue de Seine. His
modest sign was no longer there, but instead of it one of:</p>

<p>“Lamballe, coiffeur et parfumeur.”</p>

<p>Astounded, he rushed into the little shop; “Madame Desruelles,”
he said, “where is she?”</p>

<p>The attendant answered, “In America. It is four months
since she went—at the summons of her husband!”</p>

<p>“At the summons of me!” cried Scipion, sitting down
abruptly. “This is all a dream!”</p>

<p>Before he could say another word, a sergeant de ville
entered the shop and laid hands upon him. “You are
wanted, Quentineau.”</p>

<p>“I am not Quentineau—I am Desruelles!” shouted the
unhappy man, but the officer of the law was incredulous, and
bore Scipion off to prison.</p>

<p>He was examined on a charge of coining and of passing
counterfeit Napoleons upon the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dame du comptoir</i> of the railroad
restaurant at Rouen, and fully committed for trial as
Quentineau, alias Desruelles, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">faussaire</i>.</p>

<p>Desruelles employed an able advocate, and laid all the
facts before him. “It is a mere question of mistaken identity,”
said the lawyer, “and of course there will be no difficulty
in proving who you really are—a boutiquier of the Rue de
Seine, of twenty years’ standing.”</p>

<p>But the advocate reckoned rather too hastily. One of the
most interesting trials that ever came off in Paris, now
ensued. The advocate employed by Desruelles was thoroughly
persuaded of his client’s innocence and good character, but
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Procureur Imperial</i> was of a different opinion. The case
was sent before the Court d’Assises, and was tried by the
president. A great number of witnesses were called, and
the whole question turned upon the identity of the prisoner,
by the mutual agreement of parties, for the reason that
if the accused were Desruelles his account of how he received
the gold Napoleons (admitted to be counterfeit) was probable;
but if he were Quentineau, no defense was possible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
Quentineau was established to be a desperate character, who
had been several times convicted of minor offenses, such as
smuggling, and was more than suspected of being a criminal
of much deeper dye—a counterfeiter and forger.</p>

<p>The testimony of the customs officers at Havre and of the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dame du comptoir</i> at Rouen was first taken, and then a mass
of police testimony to prove that Desruelles was unquestionably
Quentineau. This was chiefly from the provinces,
Quentineau having apparently operated very little in the capital.
At the outset the defense experienced an unexpected
difficulty. There were some hundreds of witnesses willing to
swear that they knew Desruelles perfectly well, but not
nearly so many who were satisfied that the prisoner was that
person. His hardships, his voyages, his poverty had told
upon Desruelles. He was deeply sunburnt, his hair was
grizzled, his hand was hard, his manner nervous and excited—as
little like as possible to the placid shopkeeper of the Rue
de Seine. Unquestionably the accused resembled Desruelles
remarkably, and knew as much about that person’s antecedents
as if he were really himself, but then—. In short,
Desruelles’ neighbors were exceedingly conscientious, and
the police exceedingly positive, and the unfortunate shop
keeper was convicted of being not himself at all, but Pierre
Quentineau, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">faussaire et faux monnayeur</i>.</p>

<p>The rebutting testimony adduced by the advocate general
not only convinced the jury but overwhelmed Desruelles. It
was a letter which one of his neighbors, a woman, testified
she had received from Desruelles’ wife, from New York, that
she and her Scipion were happily accommodated with a shop
and a thriving custom in Broadway in that great city! Desruelles
admitted that the handwriting was his wife’s, but the
statement impossible, for the reason that he was in the Palais
de Justice, and consequently could not be in New York.</p>

<p>Pierre Quentineau, calling himself Scipion Desruelles was
sentenced to ten years’ close imprisonment.</p>

<p>The unhappy convict was moved by his sense of injustice
to carry himself with unexpected dignity. He shed no tears,
but said he felt certain that time would remove the evils that
now bore upon him so heavily. He was sent to Brest, and
set to learn the trade of shoe-making. He was one of the
most tractable prisoners ever confined at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bagnes</i>.</p>

<p>When Scipion had served out three years of his sentence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
an unexpected episode occurred in his history. Visitors were
announced to Quentineau. He went to the office of the
prison and found his Martinique cousin, Pache, and—his
wife! He attempted to throw himself into the arms of the
latter, but was repulsed with severe dignity.</p>

<p>“We know you are not Quentineau, but Desruelles,” she
said; “but there are crimes charged against Desruelles.”</p>

<p>Scipion demanded an explanation and his release, but
Madame was inexorable.</p>

<p>M. Pache then told him to wait. Through influence, and
the facts presented by the Martinique cousin, the Court of
Cassation had consented to re-examine the question as to his
identity. “Of course you are Desruelles,” said M. Pache,
confidently, “and I mean to prove it, if it costs me a million.”
After you are shown to be not Quentineau but Desruelles, it
will be time enough to go into Madame’s grievances.</p>

<p>Desruelles was now brought back to Paris, and M. Pache
set to work to establish his cousin’s identity.</p>

<p>The notary he employed suggested that M. Jules Favre be
retained as advocate and that eminent lawyer consented to
take the case, but two days later sent a note declining to serve
on account of the pressure of uncontrollable circumstances.
M. Plongoulm, was consequently retained.</p>

<p>After various delays, the case of Desruelles or Quentineau
was again called up, this time not before a jury, but before
the first President of the Court of Cassation. The array of
witnesses was formidable, and the testimony of the most conflicting
character. For the Procureur’s side a great number
of witnesses were brought who positively identified Desruelles
as Quentineau. In addition to this, substantial proof was
brought to the fact that Desruelles himself was dead. One
of the sailors of the brig Braganza was produced, who had
made the Martinique voyage with Desruelles. This man
testified that after cargo was discharged at New Orleans the
brig took on cotton and was towed down the river on her
return voyage. Off Chandeleur Bay the brig was boarded
by a tug from Lake Bargne, and Desruelles came aboard
from her. Three days out Desruelles was taken with yellow
fever, and died just as the brig dropped anchor in the harbor
of Basse Terre, Gaudeloupe. He was buried on the extreme
eastern point of the island after a considerable difficulty with
the authorities, who deeply resented the brig’s anchoring at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
the island with such a fatal disease aboard. The log of the
Braganza and the burial record from Guadeloupe were presented
in court in corroboration of the sailor’s testimony,
which made a deep impression.</p>

<p>For the side of the defense Mme. Desruelles positively
identified her husband, naming marks and peculiarities upon
his person which were found to be singularly identical with
those on the prisoner’s person. An amusing colloquy between
her and the prisoner was permitted, in which both were seen
to be mutually so intimate with all the details of a domestic
life together of twenty year’s standing that nothing short of
a miracle could suppose the privity of a third party. The
books of the shop were produced and the two went over them
together, witnesses being called to corroborate these minutiæ
whenever they concerned a third party, and it was thus shown
by a mass of particulars that if the prisoner were really Quentineau,
he must likewise be Desruelles. Having gone so far,
the ingenious advocate proved, by an accumulation of circumstances
that Desruelles could not be Quentineau.</p>

<p>The President of the Court, who seemed to take a great
interest in the problem on trial before him, questioned Mme.
Desruelles as to the cause of her sudden trip to New York.</p>

<p>She pointed to Desruelles with a scornful finger. “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ca!</i>”
she cried, “he had a mistress; he wished to abandon me; he
called me Cosaque! He appointed to meet her in New York
after settling up his cousin’s estate. I determined to make his
amours uncomfortable. I pursued the woman to New York.
I pulled her hair; I boxed her ears; I made her flee in
dismay to California; then, my mission performed, I returned
to Paris.”</p>

<p>The unhappy Scipion, in utter prostration of astonished
protest, lifted his helpless hands and denied the mistress, the
assignation—everything.</p>

<p>His wife turned away with an incredulous, scornful shrug.</p>

<p>“I have your letters, Monsieur. I compelled the creature
to surrender them to me.”</p>

<p>The President ordered Mme. Desruelles to produce the
letters, and while the huissier was gone examined M. Pache.</p>

<p>The latter gentleman testified as to the facts of Desruelles’
visit to Martinique, the false will, etc., and positively identified
Desruelles.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen that will?” asked the President.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
“No,” said Pache.</p>

<p>“I have it here,” said the President. “It is duly authenticated,
signed and sealed—look at it!”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! that is my own signature, and that notarial
signature I would swear to as Alphonse Domairon’s!”</p>

<p>At this moment the huissier came into court with the package
of letters, which he handed to the president. That officer
looked over them, with Pache still upon the stand.</p>

<p>“M. Pache,” said the president, handing a letter to the
witness, “do you identify that handwriting?”</p>

<p>“I do; it is undoubtedly Desruelles’.”</p>

<p>“Be kind enough to read that letter aloud to the Court.”</p>

<p>M. Pache, adjusting his eye glasses, read, “Ma Mignon:
The will is all perfect. The Cosaque totally deceived. I sail
for Martinique to-morrow, and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ma poudre de succession</i> will
make short work of my stumbling-block of a cousin!”</p>

<p>He turned severely upon Desruelles: “Atrocious wretch!
You plotted to poison me, then! I abandon the case.”</p>

<p>Desruelles fell back fainting. Mme. Desruelles eagerly
came forward. “I swear, Judge, that letter was not in the
parcel I received from Mlle. Tolly! I never saw it before!”</p>

<p>The president turned from her coldly. “The handwriting
is precisely the same.”</p>

<p>The prisoner, reviving, stared around him with a ghastly
face, and the president looked down upon him gloomily.</p>

<p>“The Court,” he said, “is not able to determine with satisfaction
whether the prisoner is Desruelles or Quentineau.
The evidence preponderates in favor of Desruelles. But, so
far as the ends of justice are concerned, it does not matter.
Quentineau was a bad man, but Desruelles is evidently a man
much worse. The prisoner is remanded to serve out his
sentence, and at the expiration of his full term is doomed to
transportation to New Caledonia for fifteen years.”</p>

<p>Desruelles fainted once more and was removed. That
afternoon, waiting wearily in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salle des gardes</i>, a man came
and stood before him, looking at him fixedly, then turning
away. Everybody paid him the utmost respect. Desruelles
asked the sergeant by his side who that personage was.</p>

<p>“It is M. M——, chief of the secret police.”</p>

<p>“Good God!” cried Desruelles—“Vedova!”</p>

<p>He fell in an apoplectic fit, and before morning brought the
question of his identity to the tribunal of a higher court.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_9">THE DEVILS IN HEAVEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="credit">(A legend of the Origin of the Daisy: German of Rudolf Baumbach:
Translated for Short Stories by Albert Gleaves.)</p>

<p>It is usually thought that when good children die they go
to heaven and become angels. But if anyone imagines that
they live there with nothing to do but fly around, and play
hide-and-seek in the clouds, he is very much mistaken.</p>

<p>The angel children have to go to school every day like the
boys and girls on earth, three hours in the forenoon and two
hours in the afternoon. They write with gold pencils on
silver slates, and instead of the A B C books, they have story
books with all sorts of gay-colored pictures. They do not
study geography, for a knowledge of the earth would be of
no use in heaven, neither do they learn the long and terrible
multiplication table, because they live in Eternity.</p>

<p>The school teacher is Doctor Faust. He was a magistrate
on earth, but on account of certain affairs that caused him a
good deal of trouble and were very much talked about, he
was required to teach school for three thousand years before
he can have a vacation. On Wednesday and Saturday afternoon
there is no school, and the children are permitted to
play by themselves in the Milky Way; but on Sunday, which
is the grand holiday, they can go outside of heaven and play
in the big meadow. There they enjoy themselves more than
all the rest of the week put together.</p>

<p>The meadow is not green but blue, and thousands and tens
of thousands of silver and golden flowers are all aglow with
light and men call them stars.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the great holiday, St. Peter takes care
of the children, while Dr. Faust rests and recuperates from
his labors during school-hours. St. Peter, who is always on
guard at the gate of heaven, sees that there is no boisterous
playing, and no running away or flying off too far; if he discovers
any straying or wandering, he at once blows on his
golden whistle the call to “come back.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>One Wednesday afternoon it was very warm in heaven and
St. Peter fell asleep, tired out with watching. The children
noticed this and took advantage of it to steal by the old man
and spread themselves over the entire meadow. The most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
enterprising ventured out to explore the extent of their play-ground,
and discovered that it was abruptly ended by a high
board fence. This they examined carefully for cracks to look
through, but finding none flew to the top of the fence and
commenced shouting across the space beyond.</p>

<p>Now hell was on the other side of the fence, and a multitude
of little devils had just been driven out of the door.
They were coal-black, with horns on their heads and long
tails behind. Soon they looked up and saw the angels above
them fluttering around the top of the fence, and at once they
began to beg that they might be allowed to come up into
heaven, promising faithfully to behave, if only the angels
could let them in for “just a little while.”</p>

<p>Moved with pity, the innocent angels decided to get the
Jacobs’ ladder out of the garret and let the little imps come
up. Fortunately St. Peter was still asleep and they managed
to drag the ladder out without disturbing him. After a good
many efforts they succeeded in raising it up against the fence
and then lowering it into hell. It scarcely touched the
ground before the long-tailed little varlets were swarming up
the rounds like monkeys.</p>

<p>When they got near the top the angels took them by the
hand and helped them over the fence.</p>

<p>This is how the devils got into heaven.</p>

<p>At first they behaved very well, tiptoeing here and there,
and carrying their tails under their arms like a lady’s trail, as
they had often seen the big devil grandmothers do. But this
didn’t last long, and in a few minutes they began to let themselves
out and give full vent to their feelings. They turned
hand-springs and somersaults, and growled and yelled like
veritable imps. They mocked the good and happy people
who were dreamily looking out of the windows of heaven;
they stuck out their tongues and made faces at them.</p>

<p>Finally they began to tear up the flowers and throw them
down on the earth.</p>

<p>In the meantime the little angels had become very much
frightened and bitterly they repented their rashness in letting
such unmannerly guests into heaven. In vain they pleaded
with the rascals to be quiet and go back to hell, but the devils
only laughed at them.</p>

<p>At last, in despair, they awakened St. Peter and tearfully
told him what they had done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
He clasped his hands over his head, as he always did when
angry, and thundered, “Come in.”</p>

<p>And the little angels went sneaking through the gates, very
crestfallen, with wings drooping and trailing on the floor.
Then St. Peter called for the sleeping angel policemen, and
when all the devils were caught, they were hand-cuffed and
taken back where they belonged.</p>

<p>But this was not the end of the matter. For two consecutive
Sundays the angels were not allowed to leave heaven,
and when they were permitted to play they had to take off
their wings and halo; this was the severest of all punishments
for it is considered a great shame for an angel to be
seen without his wings or his nimbus.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>It is an ill-wind that blows no good. The flowers that the
devils threw out of heaven, took root in the earth and grew
from year to year. To be sure these star-flowers have lost
much of their heavenly brightness, but they are still lovely
to look at with their great hearts of gold and silver glory.</p>

<p>And because of this heavenly birth they do indeed possess
a hidden power of their own.</p>

<p>When a maiden with doubt in her soul plucks off the
white petals of the flower one by one, singing at the same
time a certain song, she knows by the token of the last little
petal the answer to the question of her heart.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_10">THE RACES ON THE NEVA</h2>
</div>

<p class="credit">(French of Iola Dorian: Nita Fitch: New York Saturday Review.)</p>

<p>It is the morning of the Epiphany.</p>

<p>The intense cold of the night has moderated, but the barometer
still marks fifteen degrees below zero. From the tall
steeples of innumerable churches the bells of St. Petersburg
ring in the sacred feast. In an exquisitely appointed room
of a palace, where tender lights filter through the golden
shadows of silken hangings, sits a woman. Her attitude is
one of repose, deep, unruffled. From the crown of her little
flame colored head, to the tip of her dainty shoe, she is a perfect
bit of dame Nature’s art. If she were standing we
should call her tall, but she sits crouching in her chair with
all the abandon of a dozing tigress. She gives a little yawn.</p>

<p>“Ah! late as usual,” she says aloud.</p>

<p>As she speaks the door opens and a servant enters.</p>

<p>“Captain Repine,” he announces.</p>

<p>He follows quickly on the man’s heels, short, thickset, with
a dull Cossack face and kindly smile, wearing the uniform of
an officer of the Imperial body-guard.</p>

<p>“Pardon, my dear Elisaveta. Have I made you wait?”</p>

<p>She gives her shapely shoulders a slight shrug, but watches
him with contemplative eyes as he rattles on.</p>

<p>“Imagine, my beloved, I thought that I should not be able
to take you to the races. I was so rushed at the last moment.
Oh! but they will be superb! Never has the track been more
perfect; hard as a rock and not a flake of snow.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” says the lady languidly. Putting out a lazy,
be-ringed hand she draws back the curtain that hides her
window. “It is superb,” she assents.</p>

<p>“You know how difficult it is to accomplish that,” continues
the young officer, “with this cursed wind drifting the Ladoga
snow. Still I must tell you that five hundred men have
worked all night at it. Brave fellows!</p>

<p>“The journals say something of a three-horse-race.”</p>

<p>“Yes; the event of the day. But come—”</p>

<p>“We have still an hour,” she answers, and motions him to
a seat beside her.</p>

<p>“No, no, at your feet, always at your feet, Princess Veta,”
says the young man gayly, flinging his head back to better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
look into the opal-tinted eyes above him. Keeping time
with a heavy finger, he sings in a not unmusical baritone,
two lines from a French love song:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Quand tu seras ma femme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">M’obeiras—tu mieux?”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But the fair Elisaveta is oblivious to the importance of his
melody’s burthen. With her little pointed chin against the
rose of her palm she sits lost in a world of reverie.</p>

<p>“Do you remember Sergius Hotzka?” she asks suddenly.</p>

<p>He shrugs his shoulders, accustomed to the willful wanderings
of the great city’s petted belle.</p>

<p>“How could I ever forget him,” he says in turn. “Was
there ever a man who left more ineffaceable traces behind
him? He was an original madman.”</p>

<p>“Original!” echoes Elisaveta. “Ah! what a cowardly
word. Original?” she repeats, as though interrogating her
own thought. The young man frowns slightly, but she goes
on with calm retrospection. “Only three years ago,” she
said, “and he appeared among us like some brilliant meteor;
fabulously rich; astonishing the world with his eccentric
prodigalities. Then all those clod rooting swine, they deserted
him when he was no longer wealthy.”</p>

<p>Her lover’s white teeth are like a wolfish danger signal as
he turns to look at her.</p>

<p>“My dear,” he says coldly, “you can’t expect the world
to be faithful to a proscript.”</p>

<p>“Proscript?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. They say that political complications were his
ruin. At any rate he is banished from St. Petersburg.”</p>

<p>“Then he is in Siberia?”</p>

<p>With all a soldier’s diplomacy he says indifferently: “I believe
not. The peasants tell a story of a hermit of the Steppes,
who mends kettles, and plows for the farmers. Many believe
it to be Hotzka with the remains of his own famous stud.”</p>

<p>“Farmers,—Kettles,” echoes Elisaveta, absently.</p>

<p>Suddenly she turns on her moody swain.</p>

<p>“Come, Alexander,” she cries; “I can see the crowds
gather from here. Quick—we must hurry.”</p>

<p>It is scarcely a half-hour later and the race course presents
a brilliant spectacle. The river Neva is now only a colossal
roadway, between two walls of splendid rose granite that
line its quays. It is a mirror of polished steel. Stands, richly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
decorated with flags, occupy at least a quarter of the inclosure,
and over a hundred thousand spectators surround the arena.
In the center of everything, a great pavilion draped in purple
and gold shows that royalty is expected to take part in the
city’s festival. A huge figure in a white uniform shows itself.
The impassiveness of this countenance, with its eagle profile
and small glittering eyes, is unmistakable.</p>

<p>’Tis he, the Autocrat—the Emperor of all the Russias.</p>

<p>From the human hive mounts and swells a growing noise;
cries, oaths, calls from the <em>Kras</em> senders, all blend themselves
in a formidable roar: “Long live the Tzar!”</p>

<p>At this moment a rosewood sled, drawn by white horses,
stops in front of the box nearest the royal pavilion; the
president of the jury precipitates himself at the horses feet
and aids a young woman to descend. The tall figure, with its
long, loose wrap of priceless blue fox and its aureole of
wonderful red hair, is well-known in St. Petersburg. She is
the Princess Elisaveta Palorna, the beauty of three seasons.
Repine follows her. Under her little fur cap, with its jeweled
fez, Veta’s eyes look out, serene, impenetrable. A bell sounds
and silence falls on the waiting multitude. From open gates
stream a dozen or more horses harnessed to light sleds of
gilded osier. They are pure blooded Arabians, thickset
mustangs from the Steppes, and highly bred Orloffs with
sweeping manes white and shiny as spun glass.</p>

<p>The people watch these preliminaries apathetically. They
are waiting for the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">piece de resistance</i>, the three-horse-race with
princes as drivers. Already four races have been run, the
track is cleared and the five hundred workers take up their
task of sweeping away the powdered ice beaten up by the
iron hoofs. Once more the gates open and three splendid
bays appear with the same sled of gilded osier, but larger and
more elegant; they are followed by three black Finlanders,
with shaggy coats and tails that sweep the ground. The last
comers are Orloff stallions, white and dazzling as the snow
itself. Their short hair glistens as though oiled, and silver
reflections shadow their smooth flanks and elegant necks;
their mouths are black and their nostrils immense, quivering
and rose-lined; their eyes, tender, yet prominent and full of
fire, are circled by a sooty ring like those of the Asiatic
women. They are the pets of the hour. There they stand,
the nine superb creatures, controlled by a splendid discipline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
that does not permit the most timid pawing of their impatient
hoofs, and with over two hundred thousand eyes admiring
their matchless perfection.</p>

<p>Three sorry horses, emaciated and sad, splashed with mud,
and covered with a ragged harness, half string, half leather,
advance slowly into the arena; behind them trails a clumsy
vehicle, made from the bark of the Russian fir tree, and
shaped like the Laplander’s hunting sled. With drooping
heads and dragging limbs the weary beasts come forward and
place themselves beside their aristocratic predecessors. A cry
of horror rises up from the crowd. Leaning back in her box,
Veta watches the late arrivals with fixed intentness.</p>

<p>The bell rings noisily. The race commences.</p>

<p>The bays lead by several lengths. The middle horse, an
old favorite, lifts his feet with all the alluring charm of a star
of the nation’s hippodrome; his companions, brothers from
the Don, thin and ardent, run without effort. After them
come the Finlanders tearing furiously on the reins. Sufficiently
in the rear to astonish their backers, are the Orloff
stallions veritable wonders of beauty and breed.</p>

<p>Finally, following at a long distance behind their royal
leaders, are the three strange beasts with their Laplandish
sled. They run irregularly, and their little thin bells give out
a melancholy sound. It is in this order that the sleds pass
for the first time in front of the judges’ stand.</p>

<p>Half way on the second round the Finlanders fling out their
sturdy heels with such velocity that they look like the half
circle of a bounding hoop. They pass the bays. A quick
swelling of their massive chests and they forge ahead.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shriek the people, ravished with the success of
their favorites. At this moment the unknown peasant straightens
up his giant frame. Pushing back the heavy hat drawn
down to his eyes, he grips the reins with an iron hand and gives
a curious prolonged whistle. His skeleton horses are strangely
metamorphosed. As though in answer to some superhuman
command, they give one gigantic leap and fairly fly. For a
moment they run beside the white stallions.</p>

<p>“The Orloffs lead!” screams the multitude, then shudders.</p>

<p>Beyond the shapely heads of the city’s favorites stretch six
dark, pointed ears, to be followed by three heads with glaring
eyes, and foaming, blood-flecked jaws.</p>

<p>With her body stretched half out of her box, Veta watches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
them with fascinated eyes. Her chest heaves, her limbs tremble,
and her face takes on the anguish of the laboring brutes.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” whispers Repine. “They will lose.”</p>

<p>“They will <em>win</em>!” she answers hoarsely. “I know them.”</p>

<p>“The Orloffs gain,” says somebody in the next box.</p>

<p>“Ah!” groans Veta and bites her lip to the blood.</p>

<p>Once more the peasant’s whistle startles the still air, and
with a prodigious effort his horses leave the others behind.
Transfigured by the waking of their unknown blood, carried
away by a secret ecstacy, with floating manes and sonorous
breath, they rush on toward the expected goal.</p>

<p>They reach it—victorious—winners by three lengths.</p>

<p>For one long moment the people rest mute with stupefaction,
literally incapable of applause. They stare open-mouthed
at the sordid beasts that have beaten the noblest
blood of the land, then like one man they dash forward to look
at them, to ask their race, and the name of their uncouth driver.</p>

<p>As the victors pass Veta leans out to look at them.
“I must see them,” she says aloud.</p>

<p>At the sound of that voice, the peasant starts. Lifting his
head their eyes meet. She pales but that is all.</p>

<p>Months have passed, and the extraordinary event that
astonished the Peterbourgeois is no more than ancient history.
Nobody has learned the identity of the mysterious peasant.
Many believed him a sorcerer. Others thought him a great
doctor of some unknown science, whose powerful potion had
galvanized the exhausted beasts. But it is all only a memory
now. A new sensation is on the <em>tapis</em>.</p>

<p>All St. Petersburg is talking of the marriage of Prince
Alexander Repine to Princess Elisaveta Palorna.</p>

<p>It is evening, and Veta stands for the first time in her husband’s
home. She is alone, on a great veranda that half
circles the palace. She still wears her wedding dress, and
the stones of a diamond tiara sparkle in her hair.</p>

<p>“Mistress,” says a voice behind her. She turns to confront
her husband’s faithful old servant. “Mistress, a present
awaits you at the palace gate. Shall I lead you thither?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>She follows him down the steps with all the lazy insolence
of a fine lady who grants a favor; her long gown sweeps the
dew off the grass, and the moonlight mirrors itself in the
soft curves of her naked arms and shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
Presently she stops, stricken by a mysterious influence.</p>

<p>A moment more and a strange sight meets her view.</p>

<p>They are the winners of the Neva.</p>

<p>With a wave from her hand, Ivan goes.</p>

<p>The horses whinny softly at the sound of her voice, and
nose her hair and face with dog-like gentleness.</p>

<p>“Why are you here?” she whispers, a sudden catch in her
throat that she stifles against the emaciated cheek nearest her.</p>

<p>From out of the deep shadow comes a trembling voice.
“Why do you weep, Princess?” it says.</p>

<p>She sees him now for the first time, still in his peasant’s
garb and with head uncovered, low before her. It is a noble
head, with splendid lines and a beautiful mouth, but worn
and shadowed as those of the famished beasts beside him.</p>

<p>“Why are they like this, Sergius? The best racers in the
kingdom could have brought their price; there certainly was
no need to starve them.”</p>

<p>“We have starved together, Princess,” he answers gently.</p>

<p>“Then the story that the people tell is true?”</p>

<p>“Quite true.”</p>

<p>With the skeleton creatures between them they are silent a
wavering moment. Then with a mute caress of their unkempt
necks he says: “Be kind to Sergius Hotzka’s only friends.
Good-night, Elizaveta Repine.”</p>

<p>“Repine!” she had forgotten that.</p>

<p>“Is it farewell?” she asks him blindly.</p>

<p>“Farewell!” he repeats.</p>

<p>The horses whinny piteously as the gates close behind
him; then turn with dumb, questioning eyes to the pallid
woman beside them.</p>

<p>Brutes that they are they tremble at the sight of that
countenance, quivering and terrible.</p>

<p>“Wait,” is her husky whisper.</p>

<p>With her face pressed tight to the iron bars, she watches
him turn an angle in the roadway; his footsteps die away
in the distance; he is gone.</p>

<p>Flinging the gates wide open she says one word:</p>

<p>“Go.”</p>

<p>A sudden rush, and they are swallowed up in the night.</p>

<p>The next day the newspapers contain a sensation.</p>

<p>Three wild horses have killed a prince’s bride.</p>

sent unto Vaphres, King of Egypt, and Nabonassar, King of
Babylon, and Shalmaneser, King of Assyria, and unto others
of the Kings round about, whether they were friends or
whether they were enemies; Hadad, King of Edom; Hiram,
King of Tyre; and Reson, King of Damascus, who alone of
the princes of Syria refused to bend the knee to the King
of Israel, saying: “Greeting from my lord Solomon, King of
Israel, who desireth to play with thee at the chess. And whosoever
among ye is minded to play with me at the chess,
either I will come unto him, or otherwise, if he will, he shall
come to me at the House of Millo, in Jerusalem; and if he
win of me a game he shall have ten of the cities of Israel of
them that are nighest his own borders; but an if he lose, he
shall forfeit me ten cities of those of his own country that are
nighest the land of Israel.” And King Vaphres, which is
Pharaoh, and the other Kings played with King Solomon, and
the Lord gave King Solomon the upperhand of them all, so
that he gat fifty walled cities beyond the borders of Israel,
and made broad the borders of Israel from the River Euphrates
unto the land of Egypt, so that he ruled all the kingdoms,
as it is written, even from Tiphsah unto Uzzah.</p>

<p>And it came to pass after a time that there was no man so
bold that he durst adventure to play King Solomon at the
chess unless he should give him the advantage, as three of
the foot soldiers, or an elephant, or a camel of the right hand
and a knight of the left, or the like. And all of his viziers
and all the poets and musicians of the Temple he made a-weary
of their lives because of disappointment. For he would say,
“O, such an one, do thou play me at the chess, and I will
give thee three or four, as it might be, of my fighting men;
and if thou win the game of me I will give thee a garment of
broidered work of Hind worth a thousand pieces of gold, or
a sword of the steel of Cathay with a hilt wrought of a single
emerald, such as no King hath in his treasury, or a charger
of the colts of the dams of Arabia by the steeds of the sea.”
So they played at the chess with the King, and when he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
won the game of any of them, then would he laugh and say:
“Behold, I leave thee thy robe, for it is not meet for a King
to take aught of his servants,” and he bade them fill him wine
that he might forget the bitterness of his heart.</p>

<p>But after a time it came to pass that the King was weary
of playing with his viziers and the poets and musicians of the
Temple, and his Judges, and the Captains of his guard, and
would fain find out others, whose manner of play he knew
not, to play against him at the chess. But the dread of the
King was sore in the hearts of them that he called to play
against him, and he said, “Behold, they are all daunted by
the terror of my wisdom, and I have no glory of all my skill;
for though the gazelle be fleeter of foot than the leopard, yet
ever the leopard leapeth on to the neck of the gazelle. Now
therefore will I disguise me and they that play against me
shall not know that they play against King Solomon.”</p>

<p>So he called unto him his chief vizier, Zabud ben Na, the
King’s friend, and at eventide they stained their faces and
put on garments as they had been merchants from Ophir, and
went forth into the streets of the city. And at the corner of
the King’s-avenue, which is before the House of Millo, they
met a stranger clad in a rich garment of Baalbek, walking
slowly as one perplexed, not lifting his eyes from the ground.
And Solomon said, “Peace be upon thee, O brother.”</p>

<p>And the stranger answered, “Peace be upon thee, O brother,
from the Lord of Peace, the One, the Merciful.”</p>

<p>And Solomon said, “Who art thou, and whither goest
thou, for meseemeth thou art a stranger in the city?”</p>

<p>And the stranger said, “Men call me Jareb ben Othniel,
and Vaphres, King of Egypt, this long time hath entertained
me in his palace as one of his boon companions, for I am a
poet and musician after his own heart; and even now am I
come into Jerusalem as a messenger unto Jehoshaphat ben
Abiud, King Solomon’s remembrancer, with whom I must
needs be before midnight.”</p>

<p>Then said Solomon, “It wanteth yet some hours of midnight;
come with us in the meanwhile to our lodging, and
let us pass the time with wine and music.”</p>

<p>“I will well,” said Jareb. And when they came into the
lodging King Solomon had prepared, Zabud let call for wine,
and they made merry.</p>

<p>Then said King Solomon, “Let bring the tables, that thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
and I may play a bout at the chess, and then shalt thou sing
us a song of them that delight the heart of King Pharaoh.”</p>

<p>Then Jareb said, “Sweet is the song that closeth the eyes
in sleep and giveth ease to the sick man who crieth aloud for
the soreness of his pain. When he heareth my voice, the slave
remembereth not his chain nor the outcast his poverty; the
toiler layeth aside his work and the angry man his wrath. But
as for playing at the chess at this time, I pray thee hold thy
servant excused, for the One Merciful, to whom be glory,
hath laid a burden on thy servant, so that he cannot lose a
game at the chess even if he so would, and haply if he win a
game of thee thou wilt be an-angered, and he should seem
ungrateful in thine eyes for this grace thou has shown him.”</p>

<p>Then Solomon laughed, and spake within himself, “This
minstrel is of the children of Eblis, the braggart, and the
Lord hath given him into my hands that I may put his boasting
to shame. Surely I shall win a game of him and pull his
robe over his head, and then shall be given him a lute wherewith
to comfort the sadness of his spirit.”</p>

<p>But the King’s lips spake otherwise than the thought that
was in his heart, and he said, “Blessed be thou, Jareb ben
Othniel! I would fain lose a game unto thee, and behold, I
give thee this cloak of mine own in earnest of thy victory.”</p>

<p>And therewithal he set upon him his cloak, which was of
stuff of Tyre, with lynx’s fur, worth a hundred pieces of gold.</p>

<p>Then Zabud let call for tables, and King Solomon played
at the chess with Jareb ben Othniel; and King Solomon’s
men were of the white and Jareb’s of the black. And Jareb
played without thought, as one that could but little of the
chess, so that in a brief space King Solomon had taken
prisoner both his elephants and a knight and a camel, besides
four of his foot soldiers, while Jareb had taken but one foot
soldier of King Solomon.</p>

<p>And Solomon said, within himself, “There is no glory in
playing with a foolish lutanist such as this. Shall leviathan
put forth his strength against the gadfly? I will contrive a
combination and make an end of him.” So he made a combination
and took his captain.</p>

<p>Then Jareb rose up and made as though he would go.
And Solomon said unto him, “Whither away? for the game
is not yet played out.”</p>

<p>Then Jareb said, “O, my lord King Solomon, when thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
walkest abroad the herbs of the field, from the cedar of
Lebanon to the hyssop on the wall, find themselves a tongue
to tell thee of their several virtues, yet hast thou not heard
the voice of these chess men. See now and behold if thy
servant should move yonder foot soldier on to the next square,
where would my lord the King be then?”</p>

<p>And Solomon looked at the tables, and behold if his
adversary should play his foot soldier on to the next square
the King was checkmated without redress.</p>

<p>And when he understood that his name was known of
Jareb and that he was defeated, a mighty wrath gat hold
upon King Solomon, and the world was straitened upon him.
And the blackness of the tempest was in his forehead, and
his voice was as the thunder in the hills. And he drew his
sword and smote off the head of Jareb as he stood.</p>

<p>Then said he to Zabud, “Cast me this dog’s carrion into
the ditch without the city, that the fowls of uncleanness may
feast themselves therewithal.”</p>

<p>But behold there was no dead body, neither any blood;
and Zabud said, “May God, to whom be glory, preserve my
lord the King. Verily this man was a sorcerer.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said King Solomon, “he was no sorcerer, for
always the jewel of my girdle warneth me so often as one
who useth witchcraft cometh into my presence; yet as at this
time it spake not. But said he not that he was bound unto
the house of Jehoshaphat, our remembrancer? Haste thee
thither and bring tidings whether thou hear of him.”</p>

<p>So Zabud went to the house of Jehoshaphat, and asked at
the gate whether such an one had been there. And the
master of the gate made answer and said, “O my lord, of a
truth such an one hath been here but even now, and he went
in unto my lord, and even as he bowed his head to salute him
my lord groaned thrice and gave up the ghost.”</p>

<p>So Zabud returned to King Solomon and told him all the
tidings. And King Solomon rent his garments for the death
of Jehoshaphat and said, “See now, this dog hath told me I
know less than naught, yet knew he less than naught himself,
otherwise would he never have thought to bear a message to
a dead man. May God not have mercy on his soul.”</p>

<p>Now, it was about a seven years’ space, and King Solomon
again disguised his countenance and went forth with his chief
vizier to seek one to play at chess with the King. And as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
they walked along the covered way of the Thousand Fountains
that leadeth to the House of Lebanon, at the corner of
the street called Yellow there met them a damsel, as it were
a moon, and her countenance was as a treasure house of the
beauty of the elements. Her hair was golden as the flames
in the circle of fire that is the uttermost girdle of the world;
her eyebrows were as rainbows and her eyes as the stars of
the air; her nose and cheeks were as flowers of the earth,
white and red as roses in the rose gardens of Sharon, and the
mole thereon of the color of the soil of Eden; her lips were
as the coral of the Seven Seas, and her teeth as pearls of the
waters of El Kerker; her garments were as the Milky Way
for the glitter of jewels, and as the nest of the Phœnix for
sweet smell of musk and myrrh and frankincense; and the
swaying of her body as she walked was as the bending of
the willow withes on the banks of Jordan when the wind
of sundown reveals the inward whiteness of their leaves.</p>

<p>And King Solomon’s eyes waxed swollen for gladness to
look upon her, and he said, “Peace be unto thee, O daughter
of mine uncle.” And she answered, “Peace be unto thee, O
my lord, and the mercy of the One Merciful.”</p>

<p>And Solomon said, “O, damsel, who art thou and whither
goest thou?” And she said, “Thy servant is a slave girl of
the household of Ahimaaz, to whom thy lord and mine, King
Solomon, on whom be peace, hath given his daughter Basmath
in marriage; and even now am I bound to the house of Ben
Abinadab, to whom our lord King Solomon hath given his
daughter Taphath in marriage, for there is a feast there
toward this night, and thy slave hath been sent for to sing.
And men call me Admatha, the daughter of Adaiah.”</p>

<p>And the King said, “What songs canst thou sing?” And
she said, “O my lord, thy slave girl hath but little skill, and
her voice to the many soundeth harsh and untuneable; yet
the lover, when he swooneth in the extremity of his passion,
is fain to hearken unto me, and my song is blessed of the
wise man to whom the vanity of all things hath been revealed.”</p>

<p>And Solomon said, “O Admatha, it is not yet the hour
of the feast; come with us awhile to our lodging that we
have prepared, and let us pass the time with wine and music
until it behoveth thee to depart.” And she answered, “Peace
be upon ye; I will well.” So they came into the lodging,
and Zabud let call for wine and they made merry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
Then King Solomon said, “Let bring tables, that thou and
I may play a bout at the chess, and then shalt thou sing us a
song to the lover in the torment of his passion.”</p>

<p>But Admatha said, “O my Lord, as for playing at the
chess at this time, I pray thee hold thy slave excused.”</p>

<p>“Wherefore so?” exclaimed King Solomon; “for my heart
is set to play with thee at the chess.”</p>

<p>Then said Admatha, “O my lord, the One Merciful, to whom
be all glory, hath laid a burden on thy slave, forasmuch as
she may in no wise lose a game at the chess, strive she never
so sore; and if she play with thee and win her game, thou
wilt haply be an-angered with her, and she should seem
ungrateful to thee for this grace that thou hast shown her.”</p>

<p>And Solomon said within himself, “I have held converse
with this damsel aforetime, for of a surety I do remember
this word she hath spoken that none may have the upper
hand of her at the chess.” And he looked upon her straitly
for a long time, yet could he call nothing to mind as of her
face or favor. And he said within himself, “Behold, that
which is, that which hath been, and that which shall be,
shall be even as that which is. Belike it was one of them I
have defeated of old who boasted himself thus.”</p>

<p>But he spake with his lips and said, “O Admatha, even
to lose a game at thy hands were sweeter than to overcome
the King of Damascus, and, behold, I give thee this cloak in
earnest of thy victory.”</p>

<p>Then Zabud let call for tables, and Solomon the King
played at the chess with Admatha the slave girl; and Solomon’s
men were of the white and Admatha’s men of the
black. And Admatha played without thought, as one that
could but little of the chess, so that in a brief space King
Solomon had taken prisoner both her elephants and a knight
of the right hand and a camel of the left, besides four of her
foot soldiers, while Admatha had taken but one foot soldier
of King Solomon. And Solomon said within himself, “What
glory is it unto me to win at the chess of this music girl?
Shall I lift a cimeter of the steel of Cathay to crop a flower
of the balsam? I will contrive a combination and make an
end of her.” So he made a combination and took her captain.</p>

<p>Then Admatha rose up and made as though she would go.
But Solomon said, “Whither away, O Admatha? for the
game is not yet played out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
Then Admatha turned about and said, “O my lord King
Solomon, when it listeth thee to sit on thy carpet the winds
become thy chariot, and all the beasts of the field fare under
thee to subdue thine enemies; and the fowls of the air fly
overhead to shield thee from the sun; yet these chess men,
that are but of ebony wood and the tusk of behemoth, refuse
to obey thee. See now and behold; if thy slave should move
yonder foot soldier on to the next square, where would my
lord the King be then? As for playing at chess, thy slave
girl knoweth naught, yet knoweth she more withal than my
lord King Solomon.”</p>

<p>And when Solomon looked at the tables, behold if his
adversary should move the foot soldier on to the next square
the King was checkmated without redress.</p>

<p>And when he understood that he was known of Admatha
and that he was defeated, a mighty wrath gat hold upon
King Solomon, and the world was straitened upon him;
the vein of fury stood out between his eyebrows, and the fire
flashed from his eyes as the blaze leaps from a burning mountain,
and the darkness which gathered on his brow was as
the smoke thereof, and his words rolled forth even as the
molten stone from the mouth of the caldrons of Eblis in
the hills of Sikkel. And he drew his sword and smote off the
head of Admatha as she stood.</p>

<p>And he cried aloud to Zabud, “Cast me this swine’s carcas
into the ditch without the city, that the fowls of uncleanness
may feast themselves therewithal.”</p>

<p>But, behold, there was no dead body, neither was there
any blood; and Zabud said, “God preserve my lord the
King! this damsel was a sorceress.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said King Solomon, “for my ring spake no word
of warning. But said she not that she was bound to the feast
at the house of Ben Abinadab? Now, therefore, go straightway
thither and bring me tidings.”</p>

<p>And as Zabud went toward the house he met a great company
of men and women weeping and wailing and rending
their garments; and when they saw Zabud they cried: “O
my lord, mayst thou survive my lord Ben Abinadab! for,
behold, as we all were feasting and making merry a certain
slave girl came into the company whom my lord bade sing to
her lute. And when she had tuned her lute she began to
sing, and before ever she had sung two words my lord turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
his face to the wall and died. Now, therefore, bear the tidings
to King Solomon with haste, for our lady Taphath, the
widow of Ben Abinadab, is a daughter of my lord the King.”</p>

<p>Then Solomon was sore troubled, and rent his garments
and cast ashes upon his head, and the days were darkened
upon him. And he said: “Who is this slave girl? for of a
surety I do remember all these things of aforetime.” Howbeit
he remembered not Jareb ben Othniel, and he said: “I am
as one that resteth on his oar when the image of his oar is
bent awry by reason of the water that is over it, so that he
seeth not aright that which he seemeth to see. O! the
waters! the waters! They have covered the whole world, so
that no man seeth truly the things that have been for the
waters that are above them.”</p>

<p>And about a space of one-and-twenty years, yet once more
King Solomon and his chief vizier disguised themselves and
went forth into the city, if haply they might find one to play
at the chess with the King. And as they came nigh unto the
Water Gate of the Temple, behold there stood at the bottom
of the steps an old man, as it were a sheikh of the Sons of the
Desert, and his hair was white as the water courses of the
hills in winter, and his beard flowed down to his knees, as it
were icicles of stone in the caverns of Hermon, and his eyebrows
were as the snow on the branches of the cedars of the
forest, and his eyes as the torches of them that seek for
Thammuz on Lebanon.</p>

<p>And Solomon said unto him, “Peace be unto thee, O mine
uncle.” And the old man answered, “Peace be unto thee
and mercy from the One Merciful.” And Solomon said,
“By what name shall I speak to my father’s brother, and
whitherward shall we bear him company?”</p>

<p>And the old man said, “I am Habakkuk ben Methusael,
the chief of the Benou Methusael, children of the Great
Desert, and I have come hither to Jerusalem that I may play
a game at the chess with my lord King Solomon.”</p>

<p>And Solomon said, “O Habakkuk, is there any of the Sons
of the Desert who is the equal of my lord King Solomon?”</p>

<p>And Habakkuk said, “Nay, my son, there is none among
the Kings of the earth who may be compared with my lord
King Solomon in riches, or in majesty, or in wisdom; yet
haply in this matter of playing at the chess, the Lord, to
whom be all the glory, hath been minded not to lay up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
whole of his treasure in a single treasure house; for thy servant
hath played with men of understanding as well as with
others these two hundred years and more, yet hath he never
lost a game to any of the children of men.”</p>

<p>And Solomon said within himself, “Now will I win a game
of this patriarch of the Desert, and afterward we will bring
him to the palace, and when he seeth that it was none other
than King Solomon himself who hath defeated him his shame
shall be the less.”</p>

<p>So he spake to the old man and said, “Behold, as at this
time my lord King Solomon hath gone to sup with the daughter
of Pharoah, in the House of Lebanon, and of a surety he
will not return till after midnight, for thy servants but even
now met the bearers returning with his litter. Wherefore do
thou come with us to our lodging, and if it irk thee not, win
a game at the chess of thy servant.”</p>

<p>And Habakkuk said, “I will well.”</p>

<p>So they came into the lodging, and Zabud let call for wine
and they made merry; howbeit Habakkuk excused himself
as for drinking of the wine for that he was of kindred with
Hammath of the tribe of Rechab.</p>

<p>And Zabud let call for tables, and Solomon the King
played at the chess with Habakkuk the Son of the Desert,
and Solomon’s men were of the white and Habakkuk’s of the
black. And Habakkuk played without thought as one that
could but little of the chess, so that in a brief space King
Solomon had taken prisoner both his elephants and a knight
of the right hand and a camel of the left, besides four of his
foot soldiers, while Habakkuk had taken but one foot soldier
of King Solomon. And Solomon said within himself, “What
glory is it to win at the chess of a dog of the desert such as
this? Doth the lightning make boast of slaying the frog that
croaketh in the marsh? I will contrive a combination and
make an end of him.” So he made a combination and took
his captain.</p>

<p>Then Habakkuk laid hold on one of his ebony foot soldiers,
and said: “O, my lord King Solomon, the One
Merciful hath given thee dominion over all ghouls and afrits
and jina and marids of the jinn, them that inhabit the houses
of the fire and them that walk on the earth or creep within
its bowels, them that dwell within the deep waters and them
that fly upon the wings of the air; yea, all them that durst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
disobey thy behests, hast thou imprisoned against the Day
of Judgment in vessels of copper, sealed in lead with thine
own seal, and hast cast them into the sea of El Kerker. Yet
hath not the One Merciful, to whom be glory, given thee
lordship over these bits of ebony and ivory that they should
do thy will; for lo, when I shall set down this foot soldier
on yonder next square, where will my lord the King be then?”</p>

<p>And Solomon looked at the tables, and behold when his
adversary should set down the foot soldier he was checkmated
without redress. And when he understood that he
was known of the Son of the Desert and had been defeated
by him, a mighty wrath gat hold upon King Solomon and
the world was straitened upon him; and his forehead waxed
dark as the Night of Retribution, and his eyes flashed thereunder
as it were the burning of the two Cities of the Plain,
and his voice was as the roaring of the fire wherewith they
were consumed. And he leapt to his feet and would have
drawn his sword to smite off the head of Habakkuk. But
Habakkuk abode still and lifted up the ebony foot soldier in
his right hand, and the King was as one striken with a sudden
palsy; and there came upon him a great whiteness and
trembling, and his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth, and
the sword dropped from his right hand.</p>

<p>And Habakkuk said unto him, “O my lord King Solomon,
where is the wisdom wherewith the One Merciful hath gifted
thee beyond all others of the sons of men? Behold now
these three times hast thou gone about to slay the servant of
the living God. How is it that thou hast not known me?”</p>

<p>And as Solomon looked straitly at Habakkuk the snow of
his hair and his beard was melted away, and the manner of his
garments were changed, and even while Solomon was yet marveling
at the change, behold it was the slave girl, Admatha,
who held up the ebony foot soldier against the King.</p>

<p>And the waters of forgetfulness were rolled back from the
King’s memory, and he said: “Verily I should have remembered
and repented, for lo this game is the very game, move
for move, that I played with thee, O, Admatha, what time thou
wert sent for to sing in the house of Ben Abinadab my son.”</p>

<p>And Admatha said, “O my lord King Solomon, of a truth
this is even so, but where is the wisdom wherewith the One
Merciful hath gifted thee beyond all others of the children of
men? How is it thou hast not known me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
And as Solomon looked straitly at Admatha her countenance
and the manner of her garments were changed, and
even while the King was yet marveling at the change behold
it was Jareb ben Othniel who held up the ebony foot soldier
against the King.</p>

<p>And the things which had been were lifted above the waters
of forgetfulness, and Solomon saw them even as they were.
And he said, “Verily I should have remembered and repented,
for lo these two games are the very same, move for move,
and combination for combination, with the game I played
aforetime with thee, O Jareb ben Othniel, when thou didst
bear a message to Jehoshaphat my remembrancer.”</p>

<p>And Jareb said, “Oh, my lord King Solomon, of a truth
this is even so, but where is the wisdom wherewith the One
Merciful hath gifted thee above all thy fellows? How is it
that thou hast not known me?”</p>

<p>And as Solomon looked straitly at Jareb his countenance
and the manner of his garments were changed, and even while
the King was yet marveling at the change a glory as of the
unspoken Name lighted his face, and his hair was as the rays
of the sun at noonday, and his raiment was as a flame of fire,
and from his shoulders came forth wings, whereof every feather
was as a rainbow after the storm.</p>

<p>And the Angel said, “O, King Solomon, where is the
wisdom wherewith the One Merciful hath gifted thee above
thy brethern? Even yet hast thou not known me.” And
the Angel still held up the ebony foot soldier against the King.</p>

<p>And Solomon said, “Verily long since should I have known
thee and repented, O Azrael, angel of death, for none save
the brother of the Four who uphold the throne of God, to
whom be glory, could have played this game at the chess that
thou hast played against me, lo these three times.”</p>

<p>And Azrael said, “Oh King Solomon, may the One Merciful
have much mercy upon thee, for thou needest much!”</p>

<p>And he set down the ebony foot soldier.</p>

<p>And King Solomon was dead.</p>

<p class="credit">(From the Silician Folk Lore Dialect: E. C.: For Short Stories.)</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a carter; he married, and took
to wife a pretty girl. The wedding over, and the newly
married pair alone, the carter turned and said to the bride:</p>

<p>“See, Rusidda (says he) now we are husband and wife.
What happiness! Now I will buy me a horse, I will make
me a cart, and so I will go with loads and we shall get bread.
But there is this about it: When I come home, I will not
work any more. Then, see, my little Rusidda, from now
henceforth when I come home, you take the horse, unharness
him from the cart, lead him in and water him; in short, care
for him, for I am tired.” The girl began to shrug her
shoulders and says, “I won’t do it!” “What do you mean?
Then who is to lead the horse in, I?” “I don’t know how
to do such things.” “Well,” says the young man, “I will
teach you.” “No, I am not used to such things. At my home
I was not taught in that way.” “Well, I will teach you
now, little by little.” “No, I won’t lead the horse in!” “But
what is to be done if you must lead him in?” “And I won’t
lead him and I won’t lead him in!” “And I tell you, either
you will lead him or you will come out badly.” “No, no;
neither now or ever!” At this the young man arose in a
rage, and unbuckled his leather belt. “Now I tell you
either you lead the horse in, or I will set on you with my
hands.... Go lead the horse in!” “No, I will not lead him
in!”—“Ah, what is that?... Go lead the horse in” ... and
he took her with a great blow of the strap on her shoulders.
What would you expect of the girl? She began to scream
like one burnt. “Alas, I’m dying ... I won’t lead the horse
in! I won’t lead him in!” “Go, lead the horse in, I told
you!...” and here blows with the strap that took off the skin.
And “Go, lead the horse in,” and “I won’t lead him in!”
The neighbors came running. “Children, children, what is
it? You are just married and begin the quarrels! What
is it? About the horse? Come off, we will lead him
in.... Where is the horse?” “But,” says the young man,
“It was talk ... we have yet to buy the horse.” “An
apoplexy take you! For a talk, you make all this disturbance!”
And the whole village fell upon them.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_14">TWO AFTERNOONS</h2>
</div>

<p class="credit">(Buckey O’Neill: San Francisco Chronicle.)</p>

<p>A hot day. The sun directly overhead, glowing with a
fire that made the air in the shadeless canyon quiver as if
heated in an oven. Not a tree in sight, not a bush—everything
brown and barren. Everywhere boulders of lava
immense in size and sometimes split in twain, as if in rapid
cooling from the intense heat which gave them birth. Here
and there between the gray-green of the giant cacti, raising
their thorny forms fifty and sixty feet in the air, assuming
with their strangely formed limbs the shapes of immense
crosses or trunks of trees from which all leaves and smaller
branches have been torn. Between the black and brown of
the sunburnt lava an occasional tuft of tall, almost colorless
grass. Over all a stillness that to one unaccustomed to the
land would seem strange and oppressive. Not a bird to break
it with its song. Even the lizards sought out what shade
they could, making with their green, red and variegated coats,
almost the only dash of color to relieve the monotony of the
all-prevailing brown and black lava that each moment grew
more oppressive to look at under the glow of the fierce heat.</p>

<p>Save these not a living thing was in sight except where off
to the west a buzzard floated high in the air, and two men,
with a burro lazily following, passing down the canyon.</p>

<p>Prospectors and their outfit.</p>

<p>Opened shirts, showing red, hairy breasts, while their loosely
buckled belts, heavy with long, bright cartridges, whose tarnished
surfaces, made doubly bright from the rays of the hot
sun, seemed strangely out of place in such quietude.</p>

<p>Neither spoke. Each walked along as if alone, looking
for the “float” that might indicate the presence of some
mineral ledge higher up, more from habit than from hope,
as the “formation” gave but little indication of treasure.</p>

<p>How hot the sun. The burro, patient-eyed, forgot his old
trick of nipping the tops of the long gaete grass, and contented
himself with keeping closely in the trail of the two
men, whose worldly possessions of blankets, cooking utensils
and tools, capped with an enormous canteen of water, he so
patiently bore. Not a breath of air stirring. Only the quivering
heat that made the eyes burn and ache. The men shifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
their rifles constantly from one hand to another, as if to avoid
getting blisters from the places where they touched the
highly heated metallic parts of their guns.</p>

<p>Crack! crack! crack!</p>

<p>Not fifty yards ahead from behind a dozen boulders leap
out as many jets of fire, while the snowy white puffs of smoke
float up a few feet and disappear in the quivering air.</p>

<p>One of the men stops for an almost imperceptible instant,
as if to brace himself. His hands rise to the level of his chest
as if to bring his rifle to his shoulder and then—down he falls
headlong to the ground in a limp mass. Dead! Shot through
the head. Not a quiver; not a motion; without a sound, were
it not for that made by his falling rifle.</p>

<p>As he falls his companion staggers back a pace or two,
catches himself, and then, half crouching, half falling, drops
behind one of the many boulders. “Hit!” he thinks to
himself, “but, thank God! not fatally; only a scratch.” Life
seems a new thing; to live, a new joy.</p>

<p>Only a scratch. “Where?” He hardly has time to think
as he places his gun across the boulder and fires at a figure,
naked, dark, clothed only in a breech clout and with a red
scarf wound around the head. He notes almost unconsciously
how pronounced its color is against the dark face
and darker hair of its wearer. “A miss!” he mentally
remarks, as the figure disappears. “But better luck next
time,” he thinks, as he pushes down the lever of his gun and
throws out the empty shell, replacing it with a cartridge.
“Short range;” he should have hit. It can’t be that he was
losing his old cunning; that his aim was bad. “No;” he
fired in haste and was “rattled.” “Another shot and he
will show them” are the thoughts that flash through his mind
as he peers cautiously ahead to discover his enemies.</p>

<p>None in sight.</p>

<p>For the first time he feels pain. Half numbness, half fire;
how it tears as he raises his shirt and looks at a little blue
hole hardly larger than a pea near the right side in the short
ribs. “Only a scratch or it would bleed worse. Did it go
through?” he asks himself, as he passes his hand up his
back to find if there be an orifice of exit. “No.” “That
is bad, for there is no surgeon to be had to cut the missile
out. Pshaw, what matters it? Other men have lived with
bullets in them—why could not he? Night would soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
come and then with darkness he would go. He was not losing
blood sufficient to weaken him much, and by morning he
would be far away. After all, it would only be a close call,
something to tell about. But poor Tom! he was gone,” and
as he looked at the lifeless form of his partner he could
hardly keep back the tears.</p>

<p>Crack! crack! go a couple of shots off to his left, and he
sees the dust flying up from near his feet. He tries to draw
his limbs up to get them in a safer position. Tries again,
and the cold sweat breaks from him. He cannot move them!</p>

<p>They are dead—paralyzed!</p>

<p>Something like a sob breaks from him. It is all over. In
the first flush of possible escape he had not thought of the
spine being injured. He knew it now. The game was played.
A few hours longer at the best. To-morrow and the next
day, and the days and the years to come would find him
there. The end was only a question of a short time. Yet he
had only thought it a scratch.</p>

<p>With his arms he drags himself into a safer position. This
done, he unbuckles his belt, and as he lays it before him to
have it handier he thinks of the time away back on the Platte
when he had first put one on. How proud he then felt, as a
stripling boy, of the outfit. How bright the future had looked,
and now it was all to end. After all, life with him had been
a hard one. It had brought to him few of the treasures for
which he had longed. For an instant he thought “why not
take the sixshooter and end it all?”</p>

<p>“Suicide?”</p>

<p>“No,” he would die fighting.</p>

<p>He would take some of them with him. Yet, why kill at
all. They were but savages—Apaches. Their deaths would
mean nothing, would gain nothing. Better to kill himself
and keep from them the satisfaction of doing it. No; relief
might come. Some of the many scouting parties of cavalry
always in the field, or, perhaps, a party of prospectors might
hear the firing, and then with a good doctor all would yet be
well. He could find one at any of the military posts.</p>

<p>All these thoughts and a thousand others crowded through
his brain while he was placing himself in a better position for
defense. Cautiously raising himself he glanced over the
boulder in the direction from whence the last shots came.
Crack! crack! crack! the bullets whiz surlily around him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
Bang! bang! bang! goes the rifle.</p>

<p>A new feeling takes possession of him. His nerves tighten
like steel, and he pumps empty shells out of the rifle’s chamber
and cartridges in with a fierce speed. Kill! kill! let him
take one of those howling murderers with him, and he doesn’t
care how soon after death comes. But what is the matter
with his aim? He has not yet killed one, not even wounded
one that he knows of. He refills the magazine of his rifle in
nervous, feverish haste, and then peeps through the crevices
of the boulders to see if there is an enemy in sight. None.
They are there, though. They are waiting and he is dying.
How hot it is! He is burning up with thirst and heat. How
“it” hurts. He has got so that he thinks of his wound only
as “it,” as if it were some terrible monster that he could not
escape. The blood—small as the quantity—that flows from
his wound has formed a pool, clotted and coagulated. It
adds to his discomfort by its stickiness. He thinks, how
strange that one’s own blood should annoy one so, and then
wonders where so many flies could have come from, as he
raises a swarm by the movement of his body. He looks
across to where the burro has fallen with the canteen and
sees that the vessel has been jammed by coming in contact
with the boulder, and that the precious fluid has nearly all
run out. How much he would give to have what little water
remains! He feels almost tempted to try to reach it, but
no; that would mean throwing his life away without a chance
for revenge. Revenge. He will have it. Thirst is nothing;
death is nothing now if he can only kill, kill!</p>

<p>If he could only kill them all, how happy he would die!</p>

<p>He looks over the boulder. Nothing in sight but boulders,
lava, cacti, sand and gaete grass. “They are there, though.”
He almost laughs in sarcasm as he catches himself scanning
the horizon to see if any relief were in sight. Relief?
For days he and the man that laid dead there had traveled
without finding a trail made by a shod horse—without finding
a trail of any kind. How childish to expect any help. Better
brace up and die like a man.</p>

<p>He looked at the body of the dead man. How hideous
the face looked with its swollen lips, open mouth, staring
eyes. How black it had grown. What a vast quantity of
blood had come from the wound in the head. His eye catches
a movement in the tuft of grass to his left. Bang! bang!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
goes his rifle. “Nothing there,” he thinks, as he crouches
closer to the ground to escape the shots that come in return.</p>

<p>So the hours go, but he hardly marks their flight. The sun
is getting lower in the west, and the white heat of day gives
way to the yellowish-purple haze that in Apache land is
always the forerunner of night. How when he was first hit
he had longed for night; how little he cared for it now. He
could feel himself growing weaker. His Winchester was
heavier than any he had ever before lifted. Even “it,” that
terrible thing that chained him there, pained him less, but the
thirst grew horrible. Anyhow night would give him a chance
to reach the canteen. At times he felt almost drowsy, but
fought off the feeling. He was merely waiting for the end.
He thought it strange that he could face it so complacently.
He hardly cared now how soon it came. Would he shoot all
his cartridges away before it reached him? He would not
waste them though. If he could only reach Tom’s gun and
revolver and destroy them it would make those that killed
him angry. It was for these things, worth perhaps $50, that
he and Tom had been murdered. He was beginning to think
of himself as already dead. At least how easy to ruin Tom’s
rifle. It was only two or three paces away. He took his
revolver and fired at it, aiming to hit it just in front and below
the hammer, its most vulnerable part. Instead, the bullet hits
the ground and ricocheting enters the breast of the dead
man. He shudders as the body stirs from the force of the
shot, although he knows that life has been gone for hours.
Everything is plain to him now why his other shots had not
taken effect. He was unnerved. How could a man with a
hole through his body hope to hit anything. He had heard
of men shot through the heart killing their assailants, and
had often wondered if he could do it. Could Tom have done
it? How far off and yet how short seemed the years that he
and Tom had been together. How little there had been in
them that seemed worth now recalling. Crack! a single
shot off to the right, and he fires where he sees the smoke
curling upward. Fires again. Nothing. He counts his
cartridges and is astonished that he has fired so many. He
must have lost some. No, there are the empty shells.</p>

<p>Another shot off to the right. One to the front. He fires
at both. He feels that he is growing nervous, and brings all
his remaining powers into play to secure better control of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
himself. He will put away the idea of death, of his wound,
of everything but revenge. Only one and he will be satisfied,
and for the first time in years he prays, prays without
words though, that he may kill but one.</p>

<p>The sun is sinking lower, it has almost reached the far off
western mountain tops. It would soon be night, and then
what would “they” do? Steal up under cover of the darkness
and shoot him from behind some boulder before he
would be aware of it. He would keep a close lookout, and
perhaps he might after all “get” one of them.</p>

<p>Crack! crack! to the right and left, and he glances in
both directions, firing at each; and then right over him takes
place a terrible explosion, and he feels as if something heavy
and blunt had struck him in the back. He half raises himself,
just enough to turn his face upward. Another explosion,
another heavy, blunt blow, and through the smoke
from a revolver he sees a dark young face, with black, glittering
eyes, white teeth, across which the lips are tightly drawn.
The face and the form of one almost a boy, and then he falls
back while a dark hand and arm snatches his gun from his
half-clinging clasp. He hears wild shouting and through his
glazing eyes sees dark forms scrambling for his arms, for
Tom’s. They are even quarreling in their eagerness to tear
the pack from the dead burro, and then instinctively he sees
one raise something in the air ... and when it falls there is no
longer anything human in the face or the head of the man
who has spent the afternoon in fight. Nothing but a bloody
pulp of skull, hair, brains, broken teeth, crushed into a misshapen
mass by the boulder cast upon it by an Apache.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Another afternoon, years after, a tall sergeant and his
detail of cavalry escorting through the canyon a party locating
a road, looks down on the whitened bones of two men
and a burro scattered by coyotes and bleached by the winds
and rains, and as he, with the toe of his boot, pushes to one
side the ribs of one of the skeletons, his eyes mark the many
empty cartridge shells. He looks up and sees that his comrades
have already noted them, while some one remarks:</p>

<p>“By——, he stayed with them while he lasted.”</p>

<h2 id="hdr_15">FOLLOWING THE SEA</h2>
</div>

<p class="credit">(Ambrose Bierce: Collected Sketches.)</p>

<p>At the time of “the great earthquake of ’68,” said Mr.
Swiddler—William Swiddler; of Calaveras—I was at Arica,
Peru. I have not a map by me, and am not certain that
Arica is not in Chili, but it can’t make much difference; there
was earthquake all along there.</p>

<p>Sam Baxter was with us; I think he had gone from San
Francisco to make a railway, or something. On the morning
of the ’quake, Sam and I had gone down to the beach to
bathe. We had shed our boots, and begun to moult, when
there was a slight tremor of the earth, as if the elephant who
supports it was pushing upward, or lying down and getting
up again. Next, the surges, which were flattening themselves
upon the sand and dragging away such small trifles as they
could lay hold of, began racing out seaward, as if they had
received a dispatch that somebody was not expected to live.
This was needless, for <em>we</em> did not expect to live.</p>

<p>When the sea had receded entirely out of sight, we started
after it; for, it will be remembered, we had come to bathe;
and bathing without some kind of water is not refreshing
in a hot climate.</p>

<p>For the first four or five miles the walking was very difficult,
although the grade was tolerably steep. The ground was
soft, there were tangled forests of sea-weed, old rotten ships,
rusty anchors, human skeletons, and a multitude of things to
impede the pedestrian. The floundering sharks bit our legs
as we toiled past them, and we were constantly slipping down
upon the flat fish strewn about like orange peel on a sidewalk.
Sam, too, had stuffed his shirt front with such a weight of
doubloons from the wreck of an old galleon, that I had to help
him across all the worst places. It was very dispiriting.</p>

<p>Presently, away on the western horizon, I saw the sea
coming back. It occurred to me then that I did not wish it to
come back. A tidal wave is nearly always wet, and I was
now a good way from home, with no means of making a fire.</p>

<p>The same was true of Sam, but he did not appear to think
of it in that way. He stood quite still a moment with his
eyes fixed on the advancing line of water; then turned to me,
saying, very earnestly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
“Tell you what, William; I never wanted a ship so bad
from the cradle to the grave! I would give m-o-r-e for a
ship!—More than for all the railways and turnpikes you
could scare up! I’d give more than a hundred, thousand,
million dollars! I would—I’d give all I’m worth, for—just—one—little—ship!”</p>

<p>To show how lightly he could part with his wealth, he
lifted his shirt out of his trousers, unbosoming himself of his
doubloons, which tumbled about his feet, a golden storm.</p>

<p>By this time the tidal wave was close upon us. Call <em>that</em> a
wave! It was one solid green wall of water, higher than
Niagara Falls, stretching as far as we could see to right and
left, without a break in its towering front! It was by no
means clear what we ought to do. The moving wall showed
no projections by means of which the most daring climber
could hope to reach the top. There was no ivy; there were
no window-ledges. Stay!—there was the lightning rod!
No, there wasn’t any lightning rod. Of course, not!</p>

<p>Looking despairingly upward, I made a tolerably good
beginning at thinking of all the mean actions I had wrought
in the flesh, when I saw projecting beyond the crest of the
wave a ship’s bowsprit, with a man sitting on it reading a
newspaper! Thank fortune, we were saved!</p>

<p>Falling upon our knees with tearful gratitude, we got up
again and ran—ran as fast as we could, I suspect; for now
the whole fore-part of the ship budged through the water just
above our heads, and might lose its balance any moment. If
we had only brought along our umbrellas!</p>

<p>I shouted to the man on the bowsprit to drop us a line. He
merely replied that his correspondence was already very
onerous, and he hadn’t any pen and ink.</p>

<p>Then I told him I wanted to get aboard. He said I would
find one on the beach, about three leagues to the south’ard,
where the “Nancy Tucker” went ashore.</p>

<p>At these replies I was disheartened. It was not so much
that the man withheld assistance, as that he made puns.
Presently, however, he folded his newspaper, put it carefully
away in his pocket, went and got a line, and let it down to us
just as we were about to give up the race. Sam made a
lunge at it, and got it. I laid hold of his legs, the end of the
rope was passed about the capstan, and as soon as the men
on board had had a little grog, we were hauled up. I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
assure you that it was no fine experience to go up in that way,
close to the smooth, vertical front of water, with the whales
tumbling out all round and above us, and the sword-fishes
nosing us pointedly with vulgar curiosity.</p>

<p>We had no sooner set foot on deck, and got Sam disengaged
from the hook, than the purser stepped up with book
and pencil—“Tickets, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>We told him we hadn’t any tickets, and he ordered us to
be set ashore in a boat. It was represented to him that this
was quite impossible under the circumstances; but he replied
that he had nothing to do with circumstances—did not know
anything about circumstances. Nothing would move him till
the captain, who was really a kind-hearted man, came on deck
and knocked him overboard. We were now stripped of our
clothing, chafed all over with stiff brushes, rolled on our
stomachs, wrapped in flannels, laid before a hot stove in the
saloon, and strangled with scalding brandy. We had not
been wet, nor had we swallowed any sea-water, but the surgeon
said this was the proper treatment. It is uncertain what
he might have done to us if the tender-hearted captain had
not thrashed him into his cabin, and told us to go on deck.</p>

<p>By this time the ship was passing the town of Arica, and
we were about to go astern and fish a little, when she grounded
on a hill-top. The captain hove out all the anchors he had
about him; and when the water went swirling back to its
legal level, taking the town along for company, there we
were, in the midst of a charming agricultural country, but at
some distance from any seaport.</p>

<p>At sunrise next morning we were all on deck. Sam sauntered
aft to the binnacle, cast his eye carelessly upon the compass,
and uttered an ejaculation of astonishment.</p>

<p>“Tell <em>you</em>, captain,” he called out, “this has been a direr
convulsion of nature than you have any idea. Everythin’s
been screwed right round. Needle points due south!”</p>

<p>“Why, you lubber!” growled the skipper, taking a look,
“it p’ints d’rectly to labbard, an’ there’s the sun, dead ahead!”</p>

<p>Sam turned and confronted him, with a steady gaze of
ineffable contempt.</p>

<p>“Now, who said it wasn’t dead ahead?—tell me <em>that</em>. Shows
how much <em>you</em> know about earthquakes. ’Course, I didn’t
mean just this continent, nor just this earth: I tell you, the
<em>whole thing’s</em> turned!”</p>

<h2 id="hdr_16">ETCHINGS: JEANNETTE</h2>
</div>

<p class="credit">(French of George Le Faure: I. S: For Short Stories.)</p>

<p>Every day there came down to the long stone wharf a
smiling fair-haired girl of seven, followed by an old, old man.</p>

<p>The child carried a spy-glass, hugging it in her arms as if
it were a doll, and she skipped along gaily till she reached
the end of the pier. Then she handed the long glass to her
companion, and resting her chubby little hands on the cold
stone coping, looked wistfully out to sea.</p>

<p>With the soft breeze blowing her hair about her shoulders,
and her eyes fixed searchingly on the horizon she stood perfectly
silent until a tiny white speck appeared in the far
distance where sea and sky seemed to mingle.</p>

<p>“A sail, a sail!” she cried, and the old man sat down and
laid the spy-glass upon his arm.</p>

<p>Breathless and eager, the child grasped the brass tube with
both hands and peered through it without speaking. After a
few minutes, however, she said with a sigh of disappointment:
“Not yet, grandpa,” and returning patiently to her post
resumed the watch until another sail appeared.</p>

<p>This was kept up hour after hour, and when the sun, a
golden ball, had slipped behind the rising billows, and a soft
mist rose from the sea, the child turned round, her little face
saddened, and walked away slowly at the old man’s side.</p>

<p>One day I spoke to an old sailor and asked about the child.</p>

<p>“That is Jeannette,” he said, taking his short clay pipe
out of his mouth, “her father was killed eighteen months
ago; the mast of his boat fell on him, and since the day
his body was carried home, she has never been the same.
She does not think that he is dead, and every afternoon her
grandfather has to bring her down here to watch for him.”</p>

<p>He tapped his head expressively, and, as a merry laugh
sounded, a smile of tenderness softened his rugged features.</p>

<p>I looked up and saw Jeannette coming as usual, carrying
the telescope, and skipping gleefully before the old man.</p>

<p>“How sad, how sad!” I murmured with a sigh, but the
old sailor shook his head; putting his pipe into his mouth
hastily he puffed out a cloud of smoke to hide the tears that
had gathered in his eyes, and answered softly—“God is good.
She will never know, and so she will never cease to hope.”</p>

<p>The house of Suddhoo, near the Taksali Gate, is two-storied,

flat roof. You may recognize it by five red handprints
arranged like the Five of Diamonds on the whitewash between
the upper windows. Bhagwan Dass, the bunnia, and a man

The two upper rooms used to be occupied by Janoo and
Azizun and a little black-and-tan terrier that was stolen from
an Englishman’s house and given to Janoo by a soldier.
To-day, only Janoo lives in the upper rooms. Suddhoo sleeps
on the roof generally, except when he sleeps in the street.
He used to go to Peshawar in the cold weather to visit his
son, who sells curiosities near the Edwards’ Gate, and then
he slept under a real mud roof. Suddhoo is a great friend of
mine, because his cousin had a son who secured, thanks to
my recommendation, the post of head messenger to a big
firm in the Station. Suddhoo says that God will make me a
Lieutenant-Governor one of these days. I daresay his
prophecy will come true. He is very, very old, with white
hair and no teeth worth showing, and he has outlived his
wits—outlived nearly everything except his fondness for his
son at Peshawar. Janoo and Azizun are Kashmiris, Ladies
of the City, and theirs was an ancient and more or less
honorable profession; but Azizun has since married a medical
student from the Northwest and has settled down to a
most respectable life somewhere near Bareilly. Bhagwan
Dass is an extortionate and an adulterator. He is very rich.
The man who is supposed to get his living by seal-cutting
pretends to be very poor. This lets you know as much as is
necessary of the four principal tenants in the house of Suddhoo.
Then there is Me, of course; but I am only the chorus that
comes in at the end to explain things. So I do not count.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
Suddhoo was not clever. The man who pretended to cut
seals was the cleverest of them all—Bhagwan Dass only knew
how to lie—except Janoo. She was also beautiful, but that
was her own affair.</p>

<p>Suddhoo’s son at Peshawar was attacked by pleurisy, and
old Suddhoo was troubled. The seal-cutter man heard of
Suddhoo’s anxiety and made capital out of it. He was abreast
of the times. He got a friend in Peshawar to telegraph daily
accounts of the son’s health. And here the story begins.</p>

<p>Suddhoo’s cousin’s son told me, one evening, that Suddhoo
wanted to see me; that he was too old and feeble to come
personally, and that I should be conferring an everlasting
honor on the House of Suddhoo if I went to him. I went;
but I think, seeing how well-off Suddhoo was then, that he
might have sent something better than an ekka, which jolted
fearfully, to haul out a future Lieutenant-Governor to the
City on a muggy April evening. The ekka did not run
quickly. It was full dark when we pulled up opposite the
door of Ranjit Singh’s Tomb near the main gate of the Fort.
Here was Suddhoo and he said that, by reason of my condescension,
it was absolutely certain that I should become a
Lieutenant-Governor while my hair was yet black. Then we
talked about the weather, and the state of my health, for
fifteen minutes, in the Huzuri Bagh, under the stars.</p>

<p>Suddhoo came to the point at last. He said that Janoo had
told him that there was an order of the Sirkar against magic,
because it was feared that magic might one day kill the
Empress of India. I didn’t know anything about the state
of the law; but I fancied that something interesting was
going to happen. I said that so far from magic being discouraged
by the Government, it was highly commended. The
greatest officials of the State practised it themselves. (If the
Financial Statement isn’t magic, I don’t know what is.) Then,
to encourage him further, I said that, if there was any jadoo
afoot, I had not the least objection to giving it my countenance
and sanction, and to seeing that it was clean jadoo—white
magic, as distinguished from the unclean jadoo which
kills folk. It took a long time before Suddhoo admitted that
this was just what he had asked me to come for. Then he
told me, in jerks and quavers, that the man who said he cut
seals was a sorcerer of the cleanest kind; that every day he
gave Suddhoo news of the sick son in Peshawar more quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
than the lightning could fly, and that this news was always
corroborated by the letters. Further, that he had told Suddhoo
how a great danger was threatening his son, which
could be removed by clean jadoo; and, of course, heavy payment.
I began to see exactly how the land lay, and told
Suddhoo that I also understood a little jadoo in the Western
line, and would go to his house to see that everything was
done decently and in order. We set off together; and on
the way Suddhoo told me that he had paid the seal-cutter
between one hundred and two hundred rupees already; and
the jadoo of that night would cost two hundred more, which
was cheap, he said, considering the greatness of his son’s
danger; but I do not think he meant it.</p>

<p>The lights were all cloaked in the front of the house when
we arrived. I could hear awful noises from behind the seal-cutter’s
shop-front, as if some one were groaning his soul out.
Suddhoo shook all over, and while we groped our way up
stairs told me that the jadoo had begun. Janoo and Azizun
met us at the stair-head, and told us that the jadoo-work was
coming off in their rooms, because there was more space
there. Janoo is a lady of a freethinking turn of mind. She
whispered that the jadoo was an invention to get money out
of Suddhoo, and that the seal-cutter would go to a hot place
when he died. Suddhoo was nearly crying with fear and old
age. He kept walking up and down the room in the half
light, repeating his son’s name over and over again, and asking
Azizun if the seal-cutter ought not to make a reduction
in the case of his own landlord. Janoo pulled me over to
the shadow in the recess of the bow-windows. The boards
were up, and the rooms were only lit by one tiny oil-lamp.
There was no chance of my being seen if I stayed still.</p>

<p>Presently, the groans below ceased, and we heard steps on
the staircase. That was the seal-cutter. He stopped outside
the door as the terrier barked and Azizun fumbled at the
chain, and he told Suddhoo to blow out the lamp. This left
the place in jet darkness, except for the red glow from the
two huqas that belonged to Janoo and Azizun. The seal-cutter
came in, and I heard Suddhoo throw himself down on
the floor and groan. Azizun caught her breath, and Janoo
backed on to one of the beds with a shudder. There was a
clink of something metallic, and then shot up a pale, blue-green
flame near the ground. The light was just enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
show Azizun, pressed against one corner of the room with the
terrier between her knees; Janoo, with her hands clasped,
leaning forward as she sat on the bed; Suddhoo, face down,
quivering—and the seal-cutter?</p>

<p>I hope I may never see another man like that seal-cutter.
He was stripped to the waist, with a wreath of white jasmine
as thick as my wrist around his forehead, a salmon colored
loin-cloth round his middle, and a steel bangle on each ankle.
This was not awe-inspiring. It was the face of the man that
turned me cold. It was blue-gray in the first place. In the
second, the eyes were rolled back till you could only see the
whites of them; and, in the third, the face was the face of a
demon—a ghoul—anything you please except of the sleek,
oily old ruffian who sat in the day time over his turning lathe
downstairs. He was lying on his stomach with his arms
turned and crossed behind him, as if he had been thrown
down pinioned. His head and neck were the only parts of
him off the floor. They were nearly at right angles to the
body, like the head of a cobra at spring. It was ghastly. In
the center of the room, on the bare earth floor, stood a big,
deep, brass basin, with a pale blue-green light floating in the
center like a night light. Round that basin the man on the
floor wriggled himself three times. How he did it I do not
know. I could see the muscles ripple along his spine and fall
smooth again; but I could not see any other motion. The
head seemed the only thing alive about him, except that slow
curl and uncurl of the laboring back muscles. Janoo from
the bed was breathing seventy to the minute; Azizun held
her hands before her eyes; and old Suddhoo, fingering at the
dirt that had got into his white beard, was crying to himself.
The horror of it was that the creeping, crawly thing made no
sound—only crawled; and, remember, this lasted for ten
minutes, while the terrier whined, and Azizun shuddered,
and Janoo gasped, and Suddhoo cried.</p>

<p>I felt the hair lift at the back of my head, and my heart
thump like a thermantidote paddle. Luckily, the seal-cutter
betrayed himself by his most impressive trick and made me
calm again. After he had finished that unspeakable crawl,
he stretched his head away from the floor as high as he could,
and sent out a jet of fire from his nostrils. Now I know how
fire-spouting is done—I can do it myself—so I felt at ease.
The business was a fraud. If he had only kept to that crawl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
without trying to raise the effect, goodness knows what I
might not have thought. Both the girls shrieked at the jet
of fire and the head dropped, chin down on the floor, with a
thud; the whole body lying then like a corpse with its arms
trussed. There was a pause of five full minutes after this,
and the blue-green flame died down. Janoo stooped to settle
one of her anklets, while Azizun turned her face to the wall
and took the terrier in her arms. Suddhoo put out an arm
mechanically to Janoo’s huqa, and she slid it across the floor
with her foot. Directly above the body and on the wall,
were a couple of flaming portraits, in stamped paper frames,
of the Queen and the Prince of Wales. They looked down
on the performance, and, to my thinking, seemed to heighten
the grotesqueness of it all.</p>

<p>Just when the silence was getting unendurable, the body
turned over and rolled away from the basin to the side of the
room, where it lay stomach up. There was a faint “plop”
from the basin—exactly like the noise a fish makes when it
takes a fly—and the green light in the center revived.</p>

<p>I looked at the basin, and saw, bobbing in the water the
dried, shrivelled, black head of a native baby—open eyes,
open mouth and shaved scalp. It was worse, being so very
sudden, than the crawling exhibition. We had no time to say
anything before it began to speak.</p>

<p>Read Poe’s account of the voice that came from the
mesmerized dying man, and you will realize less than one-half
the horror of that head’s voice.</p>

<p>There was an interval of a second or two between each
word, and a sort of “ring, ring, ring,” in the note of the
voice like the timbre of a bell. It pealed slowly, as if talking
to itself, for several minutes before I got rid of my cold
sweat. Then the blessed solution struck me. I looked at
the body lying near the doorway, and saw, just where the
hollow of the throat joins on the shoulders, a muscle that had
nothing to do with any man’s regular breathing, twitching
away steadily. The whole thing was a careful reproduction
of the Egyptian teraphim that one reads about sometimes;
and the voice was as clever and as appalling a piece of
ventriloquism as one could wish to hear. All this time the
head was “lip-lip-lapping” against the side of the basin, and
speaking. It told Suddhoo, on his face again whining, of
his son’s illness, and of the state of the illness up to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
evening of that very night. I always shall respect the seal-cutter
for keeping so faithfully to the time of the Peshawar
telegrams. It went on to say that skilled doctors were night
and day watching over the man’s life, and that he would
eventually recover if the fee to the potent sorcerer, whose
servant was the head in the basin, was doubled.</p>

<p>Here the mistake from the artistic point of view came in.
To ask for twice your stipulated fee in a voice that Lazarus
might have used when he rose from the dead, is absurd.
Janoo, who is really a woman of masculine intellect, saw this
as quickly as I did. I heard her say “Asli nahin! Fareib!”
scornfully under her breath; and just as she said so, the light
in the basin died out, the head stopped talking, and we heard
the room door creak on its hinges. Then Janoo struck a
match, lit the lamp, and we saw that head, basin and seal-cutter
were gone. Suddhoo was wringing his hands and
explaining to anyone who cared to listen, that if his chances
of eternal salvation depended on it, he could not raise another
200 rupees. Azizun was nearly in hysterics in the corner;
while Janoo sat down on one of the beds to discuss the probabilities
of the whole thing being a bunao, or “make-up.”</p>

<p>I explained as much as I knew of the seal-cutter’s way of
jadoo; but her argument was much more simple: “The
magic that is always demanding gifts is no true magic,” said
she. “My mother told me that the only potent love-spells
are those which are told you for love. This seal-cutter man
is a liar and a devil. I dare not tell, do anything or get
anything done, because I am in debt to Bhagwan Dass, the
bunnia, for two gold rings and a heavy anklet. I must get
my food from his shop. The seal-cutter is the friend of
Bhagwan Dass, and he would poison my food. A fool’s jadoo
has been going on for ten days, and has cost Suddhoo many
rupees each night. The seal-cutter used black hens and
lemons and mantras before. He never showed us anything
like this till to-night. Azizun is a fool, and will be a purdahnashin
soon. Suddhoo has lost his strength and his wits.
See now! I had hoped to get from Suddhoo many rupees
while he lived, and many more after his death; and behold,
he is spending everything on that offspring of a devil and a
she-ass, the seal-cutter!”</p>

<p>Here I said: “But what induced Suddhoo to drag me
into the business? Of course I can speak to the seal-cutter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
and he shall refund. The whole thing is child’s talk—shameful—senseless.”</p>

<p>“Suddhoo is an old child,” said Janoo. “He has lived on
the roofs these seventy years and is as senseless as a milch-goat.
He brought you here to assure himself that he was
not breaking any law of Sirkar, whose salt he ate many
years ago. He worships the dust off the feet of the seal-cutter,
and that cow-devourer has forbidden him to go and
see his son. What does Suddhoo know of your laws or the
lightning-post? I have to watch his money going day by
day to that lying beast below.”</p>

<p>Janoo stamped her foot and nearly cried with vexation;
while Suddhoo was whimpering under a blanket, and Azizun
was trying to guide the pipe-stem to his foolish old mouth.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Now the case stands thus. Unthinkingly, I have laid myself
open to the charge of aiding and abetting the seal-cutter in
obtaining money under false pretenses, which is forbidden
by Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. I am helpless in
the matter for these reasons. I cannot inform the police.
What witnesses would support my statement? Janoo refuses
flatly, and Azizun is a veiled woman somewhere near Bareilly—lost
in this big India of ours. I dare not again take the
law into my own hands, and speak to the seal-cutter; for
certain am I that not only would Suddhoo disbelieve me, but
this step would end in the poisoning of Janoo, who is bound
hand and foot by her debt to the bunnia. Suddhoo is an old
dotard; and whenever we meet mumbles my idiotic joke that
the Sirkar rather patronizes the Black Art than otherwise.
His son is well now; but Suddhoo is completely under the
influence of the seal-cutter, by whose advice he regulates the
affairs of his life. Janoo watches daily the money that she
hoped to weedle out of Suddhoo taken by the seal-cutter,
and becomes daily more furious and sullen.</p>

<p>She will never tell, because she dare not; but I am afraid—unless
something happens to prevent her—that the seal-cutter
will die of cholera—the white arsenic kind—about
the middle of May. And thus I shall have to be privy to a
murder in the House of Suddhoo.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_18">ETCHINGS: THE HUSKING BEE</h2>
</div>

<p class="credit">(R. L. Ketchum: For Short Stories.)</p>

<p>The great farm-house is ablaze with lights twinkling from
every room. Long tables groan beneath the loads of good
things the busy housewife has been days preparing.</p>

<p>From the barn come merry voices; joyous laughter.</p>

<p>Let us stand, unobserved, in the open door.</p>

<p>What a happy, merry lot of young folks—stalwart, handsome
young men and healthy maidens!</p>

<p>They are ranged around the walls with rapidly-diminishing
piles of corn before them, which they husk and throw upon
the golden heap which is growing up rapidly in the center.</p>

<p>Ah! That young man has found a red ear in his pile!
He leaps to his feet and dashes at one of the prettiest girls!
A short chase—a struggle—a resounding smack—and it is
over. He has kissed her—maybe on her collar, or her back
hair; but that doesn’t matter; she counts it all the same.</p>

<p>How happy they all seem.</p>

<p>But no. Over there in a dark corner sits a tall, powerful,
handsome young fellow all alone. He speaks to nobody
unless addressed, and then his answers are short and sullen.</p>

<p>Ever and anon he casts a piercing glance at a young man
of about his own age who sits at the end of the row opposite,
chatting with a pretty young girl. His face darkens. There
is murder in his eye. He is in love, perhaps, and jealous.</p>

<p>The bell rings for supper just as the husking is done, and
the huskers jump up and scamper pell-mell toward the house,
but the tall, handsome young man remains seated and drops
his face in his hands with something that sounds like a sob.</p>

<p>For a long time he sits thus alone, then a light, hurried
step is heard and a sweet-voiced girl asks:</p>

<p>“Joe, what’s the matter? Had trouble with Mary? You
haven’t spoken to her to-night, hardly. Sick? Better come
into supper. It will do you good, maybe.”</p>

<p>“No, Sis, it ain’t that.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Joe,” says his sister kindly.</p>

<p>“Well,” he answers, “I’ve got on my thin pants ... I rid
Dobbin over ... thar wuz a nail or a chafe in th’ saddle....”</p>

<p>And the stalwart young hayseed Adonis broke down and
shed a drenching shower of salt and bitter tears.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_19">MY BABOON BEDFELLOW</h2>
</div>

<p class="credit">(Belgravia.)</p>

<p>It has been said by the wise man of old that “there is no
new thing under the sun.” If this means that the adventure
I am about to relate was only a repetition of something that
occurred to some other hapless damsel in the pre-historic
ages, I herewith accord her my sincerest sympathies.</p>

<p>The intelligent reader must be kind enough to understand,
as a preliminary, that I am impulsive, and apt to embrace
opinions with a degree of enthusiasm and a total disregard of
all adverse arguments, however weighty, that is truly feminine.
When, therefore, shortly after leaving school, I, as my brother
says, “took up” evolution, and read various abstruse treatises
upon the “development of species” and the “descent of
man,” it was in no half-hearted manner that I rode my hobby,
but so thoroughly that I became a thorn in the flesh to
most of my relations and friends, and my schoolboy brothers,
denouncing the theory laconically, but forcibly, as “awful
bosh,” bestowed upon me the contemptuous appellation of the
“baboon,” and made unkind allusions to my frequent visits
to the Regent’s Park Gardens as being paid to “next of kin.”</p>

<p>Certainly I did resort often, almost every day, to the
monkey house to study the attributes of its interesting occupants.
Perhaps some lingering, infatuated idea possessed
me that it might be my brilliant mission to discover the
“missing link;” at any rate, my note-book of that period
contains many finely worded desires to “watch the agile monkey
in its native habitat,” and to “trace the simian likeness to
the human amid the primeval forests of another hemisphere.”</p>

<p>At length I was enabled to partially fulfill my dreams.</p>

<p>Having received a warm invitation from an old school
friend to spend some weeks with her at her home in the West
of Ireland, I started, with my maid as escort, for Ballynaghader.
My friend, Marian Edwards, had married three
years before, an Irish gentleman of some property, and I had
never seen either her husband or herself since her marriage;
so that it was with delightful anticipations of renewing an
old friendship, and forming a new one, that I set out on my
journey. My brothers accompanied me to the station, and
sped me on my way with a unanimous wish that I might meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
a gorilla or a chimpanze while taking my walks abroad in
what they persisted in calling the “wilds.”</p>

<p>My maid, Hannah, was an estimable woman, very much
privileged by reason of her long and faithful service; and as
we neared our destination after a long and fatiguing journey,
the details of which would be as tiresome as unnecessary,
became overwhelmed with dismay, falling into tears, alleging
between her sobs that P. C. B. 192 had told her the day
before we started that Ireland was a country where nobody
cared for the police. This was, in my worthy Hannah’s
eyes, the climax of barbarism; and when she proceeded to
state from “information received”—presumably from the
same reliable source—“that being murdered in one’s bed”
was considered in Ireland quite an ordinary and peaceful
way of departing this life, I felt that it behooved me to assert
myself, and, finding all soothing arguments of no avail, I
administered a sharp scolding, which had the desired effect,
and induced my abigail to dry her eyes, while she “hoped”
with an incredulous snort and desponding shake of her head,
“that things would turn out better than she expected.”</p>

<p>The prospective pleasure of my visit was largely enhanced
by the discovery that Mr. Ardagh, whom I liked directly I saw
him, was a great lover and student of zoölogy, and had quite
a menagerie of tame and wild animals, to which he was constantly
adding interesting specimens. I promised myself
great pleasure in inspecting the animals and cultivating their
acquaintance on the morrow, but was recalled from my pleasurable
anticipations to devote all my attention to an account
Marian was giving me of the mysterious loss of a very handsome
and much-valued bracelet which had occurred that very
day. Some hours before my arrival her maid had informed
her that this bracelet, which had been recently under repair
and had been returned that morning from the jeweler, was
missing. It had been laid carelessly on the dressing-table
when it arrived, and had disappeared. Search had been
made in every likely and unlikely spot, servants had been
questioned, and, as usual, under such circumstances, had all
indignantly, and some tearfully, denied any knowledge of the
missing trinket, which, apart from its intrinsic value, was
dear to Marian from associations connected with it. I could
suggest no steps for its recovery beyond the ordinary English
alternative of communicating with the police. This, I found,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
had been already done, though evidently my friends had
small hope of any good results following upon the exertions
of that estimable force, of whom, according to Hannah, no
one in Ireland stood in awe. Altogether it was an uncomfortable
state of things; and although we discussed the subject
in all its bearings, entering into the most minute details
of any burglaries we had previously heard of or read about,
we only succeeded in making ourselves distinctly uneasy, and
had to decide at last, as at first, that it was most mysterious.</p>

<p>Directly after dinner I begged that I might be allowed to
retire for the night, as my journey had thoroughly tired me.
Marian took me to my room, and, wishing me a good night’s
rest, left me to the ministrations of Hannah, whose equanimity
was thoroughly restored, and who was in a state of discursive
contentment, very trying to the patience of one whose
eyes were closing fast under the soothing process of hair
brushing, and whose sole idea was “bed,” and that speedily.
But at last I got rid of my talkative attendant; and having
as a last precaution looked under my bed (my constant practice,
though if for one moment I had supposed there could
be anything there, nothing would have induced me to look),
I retired to rest, and was soon wrapped in dreamless slumber.</p>

<p>After, I suppose, some hours, I was awakened by a loud
noise close to my bed, as of some heavy body falling on the
floor from a height; but being only partially roused, I drowsily
conjectured it was fancy on my part, and turned over on
my side, preparatory to again composing myself to sleep.
This movement brought my face opposite the window, the
blind of which I had desired Hannah to draw up the last
thing at night, that I might enjoy the sight of the sunrise, if
by some untoward and unusual event I should not sleep as
late as usual. The room was flooded with bright moonlight,
and I had an uneasy feeling as I gazed at the white expanse
of toilet-cover on the dressing-table before the window that
there was something wrong about its appearance. Suddenly
I remembered that I had certainly placed my watch and chain
on the corner of the table after winding it up the night before.
It was no longer there. Trying to persuade myself that I
was mistaken, I raised myself on my elbow to look more
carefully after my missing watch, when I distinctly felt the
bed-clothes, which my movement had a little displaced,
tugged toward the foot of the bed. Instinctively I clutched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
my retreating coverings, and in spite of some unseen opposing
agency, succeeded in restoring them to their former position,
only to feel them again slowly drawn away. Three
times this agitating phenomenon occurred. At last I determined
to abandon some portion of the bed-clothes, retaining
only the sheet, in which I wrapped myself tightly, and
watched the blankets, etc., pulled to the floor and slowly
dragged under the bed. Motionless with terror, I lay scarcely
daring to breathe, while numerous and dire possibilities
occurred to my distracted imagination. Was my unseen
visitor a moonlighter? Was this a preliminary measure to the
“murdering in one’s bed,” so graphically quoted by Hannah
from the P. C.—. 192, the well informed? Certainly I was
not in favor of home rule. Could the Land League be about
to make an example of so insignificant a unit as myself.</p>

<p>After a space which seemed to me interminable, although
it could have been only of a few minutes’ duration, my nocturnal
visitant, who had been emitting sundry very terrifying
snorts and suppressed demoniacal cackles, put out a hairy
hand, and grasped the edge of the bedstead furthest from me,
slowly drawing to its full height the body of a large baboon,
clad in a species of loose tunic. Round its neck was suspended
my chain; while the watch, still attached to the chain,
was held in its hand. I gazed horror-stricken upon this fearful
sight, recalling in a kind of agony all the stories I had
heard and read of the extreme ferocity of the baboon, remembering,
too, that my door was locked, and that I was entirely
at the mercy of a brute almost as large as, and infinitely more
powerful than myself.</p>

<p>It was not in this way that I had so ardently desired to
study the fascinating ways of the <i>Simiæ</i>, and as I thought of
my brothers’ laughing wishes at parting with me. I was
struck with a sense of the grim humor of the situation. But
the humorous aspect did not appeal to me for long, as I
watched with fascinating eagerness the movements of my
terrible visitor. With uncouth, shambling steps the creature
walked to the window, and by the light of the moon examined
my unfortunate watch. Its glittering case evidently delighted
the baboon, as it stroked it repeatedly with one finger; but
the ticking, of which it could not discover the cause or the
whereabouts, appeared to exasperate it, and it tossed the
watch contemptuously aside, though it remained dangling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
from its chain down the animal’s back. Once I made a slight
sound; but my undesirable visitor resented it by so savage a
spring in my direction that I feigned profound slumber, and
only ventured to open my eyes after several minutes of strained
expectation that I was about to receive practical illustration
of that which I had so often carelessly spoken about—the
extraordinary physical force in the fore limbs of the <i>Quadrumana</i>.
When I did dare to look again, I saw that the baboon
had seated itself before the toilet glass, and, by the aid of
my brushes and combs, was attempting to reduce its bushy
locks to some order. Finding this task a fruitless one, it
proceeded to ransack my jewel-case, which Hannah had carelessly
left open, and one by one examined various articles it
contained. Rings and brooches and bracelets the creature
appeared to approve of, but a jewel comb for the hair and a
diamond star it evidently did not at all appreciate, flinging
them down and snarling at them savagely.</p>

<p>I dared not attract the creature’s attention to myself by
making any sound, and had to watch in silent agony this
rifling and appropriation of my most cherished possessions by
an unappreciative baboon! At last it turned away from the
window, and came in a leisurely manner toward the bed, eyeing
me stealthily while it advanced; and having reached the
bedside, stooped down and proceeded to draw out from under
the bed the blankets of which it had despoiled me at a very
early stage of the operations. Upon these blankets it tried
to find a comfortable resting-place, but after turning and
twisting uneasily for some minutes, emitting short grunts of
ill-temper and dissatisfaction, it got up and, to my horror lay
down on the bed across my feet! The discomfort and pain
were almost unbearable; but fortunately after a short time
the baboon rolled further down the bed, and lay at the very
foot with its face turned in my direction. Its regular breathing
soon showed if was asleep; but I remained in an agony
of fear least some movement of mine should awaken the brute.</p>

<p>How the remaining hours of the night wore away I knew
not—to me they seemed interminable. But when the sounds
of the awakened household made themselves heard my terror
increased, for I feared that the baboon would certainly be
roused and attack me. Still it slept, and still I lay and
watched it, until Hannah’s knock at my door awakened me
to the consciousness that this could not go on forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
In a very low voice I bade my maid call Mrs. Ardagh;
and when Marian’s voice was heard outside demanding
anxiously what had happened, I hurriedly explained the
dreadful situation. To my surprise she exclaimed in what
sounded almost a tone of relief, “Why, that must be Molly!
Oh, how pleased Tom will be! Please lie quite still until I
fetch him.” My feelings, while I lay and awaited the end of
this most unpleasant adventure, may be better imagined than
described, but at last Mr. Ardagh’s voice was heard outside
the door calling in tones of authority, “Molly, Molly, come
here!” The baboon sprang to her feet, gave a startled
glance round the room, and, rushing to the fireplace, made
its exit, as it had made its entrance, by the chimney. When
the extreme tension was relaxed my nerves gave way and I
fainted. Mrs. Ardagh and Hannah, having forced the lock
off my door, applied restoratives, and, after some time, I
regained consciousness, and was able to hear a detailed
account of the capture of the baboon, which Mr. Ardagh
accomplished with much difficulty. Her escape had not been
discovered until late on the night of my arrival, and the idea
of her being in the house had never occurred to him, as all
the doors and windows were carefully fastened, and the
chimney never suggested itself to him as a mode of ingress,
though it had evidently appeared to the fancy of Molly.</p>

<p>Many of my possessions which had been appropriated by
this kleptomaniac baboon were restored to me; but my watch
was hopelessly damaged in Molly’s ascent of the chimney.
In the pocket of her tunic was discovered with my trinkets
Marian’s bracelet, which had so mysteriously disappeared,
proving, beyond a doubt, that Molly had made her escape
much earlier than was at first supposed.</p>

<p>I stayed at Ballynaghader only long enough to recruit
my strength sufficiently to travel, and then started for home,
accompanied by Marian. For a long while my nerves did
not recover from the shock they had sustained. Every one
was very considerate about it; even my brothers did not
chaff me as I had dreaded they would, and made very few
remarks anent my want of “philoprogenitiveness” when I
begged to be excused from accompanying them to the Zoo.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_20">PROFESSOR JOVANNY’S FUNERAL</h2>
</div>

<p class="credit">(Edward Iraneus Stephenson: The Manhattan.)</p>

<p>Unaffected was the regret in Yellow Bear City, Storey
County, Nevada, when, upon a certain January evening in
the year 187—, the news spread that Professor Jovanny was
dead. Professor Jovanny had been a long time (as time
runs in communities like Yellow Bear City) piano-player in
ordinary to the “Cosmopolitan Hotel and Dancing Pavilion—Ladies
Free.” Yellow Bear was yet something uncultivated. It
was true that its small population found advantage in pursuing
the study of geology, after the methods advocated by
Mr. Squeers, and that tons of gold-hiding quartz were daily
crushed through their energies; but, in spite of a weekly
newspaper, thirteen saloons (where discussion upon our
national policy not unfrequently led to—lead), an unfinished
Methodist mission chapel and six dance-houses (including the
Cosmopolitan), the advances of art and sentiment within Yellow
Bear’s straggling limits had been coy. The dint of pity
was quite a different matter. It was genuinely felt now. All
was excitement at “Cosmopolitan End,” where a notice,
nailed above the bar of the popular resort, apprised patrons,
first, of the sad event, and, second, of the omission of the
usual evening dance, which Professor Jovanny’s untimely
taking-off rendered impracticable. The street-corner next the
Cosmopolitan, just around which stood the house of mourning,
was the rallying-spot for groups of sympathizing Yellow
Bear citizens. “Poor old One-Two-Three!”—“Handlin’ a
golden harp, mebbe, by this, think?” and many other more
potent and entirely unquotable remarks and testimonials to
the virtuoso’s virtues were plentiful and loud. The old and
cracked piano itself, at the upper end of the long dance-room,
was already draped with sundry torn strips of bombazine and
white cambric. A yellow and scarcely relevant engraving of
Abraham Lincoln, which the Yellow Bear flies seemed to
have visited with cruel pertinacity, had been propped upright
upon its cover. Its legend, “We Mourn our Loss,” struck
the barkeeper as an appropriate and delicate expression of
personal grief, under the circumstances. San Monito street
was unanimous in confessing that Yellow Bear could well
have spared a better man; thereby signifying a man who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
could drink deep, swing a pick long and shoot informally—in
none of which accomplishments the dead musician had
been versed. The editor of the Weekly Intelligencer was,
during the last moments of the waning twilight, correcting in
proof an obituary headed in his heaviest-faced capitals,
“Muses in the Mud. Death of our Talented Fellow-Citizen,
Professor Jovanny.” In short, as Rioba Jack expressed it to
the crowd of choice spirits hanging about the Cosmopolitan
bar, Professor Jovanny’s decease was “a suc—cess.”</p>

<p>And as to this dead Nevada Orpheus who lay white and
rigid around the corner, and whose name, when pronounced
nearer to the Atlantic, must have been Giovanni something,
or something Giovanni, what was now to him the petty bustle
of Yellow Bear City—or what the scarcely more important
bustle that the whole round earth makes as it spins. Six
months back the “Professor” had landed in this rude mining-town
of the Sierras. Gaunt, middle-aged, travel-stained and
timid was this waif and stray of art, blown by some ironical
wind hither. Under one arm was a music portfolio; hanging
to the other, a daughter. Nevertheless, Professor Jovanny
made his advent in a smiling hour for his fortunes. Between
Dennison, proprietor of the Cosmopolitan, and the newcomer
an out-of-hand bargain was struck in very Western English
and very badly mangled Italian ditto that was satisfactory
to both parties. Professor Jovanny abode in Yellow Bear
and won reputation. Whether he had ever tried his hand at
other music than the festive waltz, jig and walk-around is
open to doubt. But certain it was that he played everything
of that stamp with such irresistible vigor and spirit that the
Cosmopolitan outrivaled all its compeers apace, and the mirth
and fun of its nightly revels (termed upon Sundays, out of
deference to religious scruples, “grand sacred concerts”)
waxed nightly more fast and furious. As for the daughter,
one single relic of her father’s early refinement asserted itself
on her behalf, namely, that not one of the Yellow Bear
species-male could truly say that he knew her. Rioba Jack,
Dennison of the Cosmopolitan, “Mister” (whose sobriquet
was the derisive contraction of one lone visiting card unfortunately
discovered among the effects of Mr. James Thornborough
Harrington, formerly of the State of Maine), nor
any of their fraternity, had been able to get the advantage
of this mortifying dilemma. The girl was hardly ever seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
upon the street, so jealous was her father’s watchfulness. In
time Rioba Jack and the rest of them came to respect this
position. That is, they ceased to combat it actively. “After
all,” remarked some one, during a discussion of the topic, “it
ain’t a bad idea to <em>have</em> one real woman in this here town.”
There happened to be a considerable female contingent already
in Yellow Bear society, so the remark last quoted evinced a
good deal of nice discrimination on the speaker’s part.</p>

<p>It was not until evening that, with the session of the wonted
parliament around the Cosmopolitan bar, the proposition to
inter Professor Jovanny with civic honors took shape. The
full quorum was present in that hospitable retreat. Distilled
liquors flowed, albeit no dance was forthcoming. Rioba Jack
rose to address the company. “It appears to me,” said that
gentleman, covering both his awkwardness as orator and his
mouth with a tumbler, when desirable—“it appears to me that
we had ought—that in view of his position in Yellow Bear—that
we had ought to give Professor Jovanny his funeral.”
“My sentiments,” interrupted an approving voice, promptly.
Rioba Jack continued: “He hain’t left nothin’ worth chattering
about, except the gal, and all gals ain’t cash. Jovanny
was a artist way above tide-level—there ain’t no mistake
about that. Talk about your celluloid-clawyers! Talk about
your Dumb Toms! Talk of your—of your scales,” the Rioba
concluded hastily, suddenly realizing that he was drifting
among breakers in any rash employment of technical terms,
“unless a man had heerd Jovanny rattlin’ ‘Where was Moses,’
in this here hotel, he hadn’t never heerd no genuine tunin’ up
at all. I say, we had ought to give Jovanny a big time.”</p>

<p>The chorus of approval came <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">fortissimo</i>.</p>

<p>“I move that Rioba Jack be app’inted a committee of one
to wait on deceased and ask his gal if the notion jumps
with her feelin’s, like as it were.” This suggestion from a
distant quarter, however mixed, was to the point. It was
carried. Every man present felt equal to himself undertaking
this preliminary; but this was no time for permitting personal
interests to dam the current of popular feeling. Rioba Jack
strode from the barroom. Applause and suggestion swelled
behind his back. “Make it a square out-and-out show.”
“Borry the Methodist’s gospel stamp.” “Pay an entrance
fee for the benefit of the gal.” “E<em>m</em>balm the corpse!” and
the like, were distinguishable among these. High over all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
tumult broke the stentorian voice of Dennison of the Cosmopolitan,
commanding order and enforcing the same by the
handle of his knife applied vigorously to a tumbler. Finally
some settled plan of action crystalized. A “square funeral”
Professor Jovanny should have. His body should “lay in
state” for the whole of the ensuing day—on the piano in the
adjoining dance-room—that piano which had so often been
shaken to its center beneath the defunct’s nimble fingers.
“Mister’s” proposal of an admission fee—for gentlemen
only—was accepted. The entire male population of Yellow
Bear City was to be duly invited to appear and “view the
remains” for the modest sum of one dollar, during any hour
of the morrow’s daylight most suited to individual convenience.
A brass band had not yet been organised in Yellow
Bear, or it would unquestionably have been provided. A free
bar was—of course. At nightfall Professor Jovanny should
be buried with all the mortuary pomp practicable.</p>

<p>Rioba Jack was greeted eagerly upon his return. “It’s
all right,” responded that worthy, composedly resuming his
seat. “Go ahead, all hands! I didn’t see the gal, but Big
Jinny and Pearl Kate are settin’ round with her, and they give
her the message. Jinny says its all right. We can go ahead.”</p>

<p>The Rioba was fully posted on the progress of affairs
during his absence. The idea of Professor Jovanny’s “laying
in state” upon the old piano alone drew forth his contempt
in round terms; which, although they betrayed surprising
acquaintance with scriptural phraseology, were by no means
pious. “D—— any such half-way style as that,” he ended,
explosively; “What <em>I</em> say is, buy the old tune-box from
Dennison and bury Jovanny <em>in</em> it!” The uproar that greeted
this novel proposal, like Prospero’s tale, might have cured
deafness. Naturally, each person present promptly claimed
to have thought of it himself—and rejected it unuttered.
Dennison announced his entire willingness to dispose of the
widowed instrument at a reasonable figure. There was a
unanimous rush into the long dance-room adjoining. Away
flew the emblems of grief dangling about the object of special
inspection. Its cover was laid off, bodily, in a twinkling.
Its length, its depth, its available breadth and strength of
bottom were excitedly ascertained. It was bought within ten
minutes by a lavish collection, Dennison mentioning a price
that certainly showed him to be an astute man in recognizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
a commercial opportunity. Thereupon did the whole roomful
resolve itself into a committee on destruction. Alas! what
soft-hearted story-teller can dwell upon the unholy hammering
and cleaving, the ruthless hacking and smashing which
ended in making visible for weeks thereafter in the back
yard of the Cosmopolitan a hideous wreck of tangled steel
wire, white and black keys and splinters of sounding-board—in
a word, the entrails of the murdered piano?</p>

<p>By ten o’clock the work was fairly done. The crowd had
departed, and only Dennison, Rioba Jack and “Mister”
now remained in the long dance-room. Dennison was
smoking, as he leaned against one end of his late piece
of property. “Mister,” with bared arms, diligently rubbed
oil over sundry scratches upon its case. Rioba Jack was
strengthening with hammer and nails some weak spot beneath.
The flaring light from a couple of oil lamps on the side of the
wall brought out strong shadows on the three dark, heavily-mustached
faces. Neither of the trio broke the silence for a
few moments. Presently the Rioba emerged from his close
quarters and began hammering at the end opposite to Dennison.
He looked up. “What’s goin’ to become of the gal?”
he queried, abruptly; “Yellow Bear ain’t no place for a
decent one like her, ’specially if she’s left alone in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve fixed that,” replied Dennison, leisurely, “Mother
Sal’s a-goin’ to take keer of her till she can do for herself.”</p>

<p>The Rioba dropped his lathe-nail and stopped his pounding.
“Mother Sal,” he repeated—“Mother Sal around on
San Monito street?”</p>

<p>“Yes! who else?”</p>

<p>Rioba Jack quietly turned and slipped on his coat.</p>

<p>“Dennison,” he said, with an unwonted accent of expostulation
lurking in his voice, “don’t do this thing. Keep
your hand out of deviltry for once—leastways such deviltry
as this. I don’t know Jovanny’s gal. I hain’t hardly ever
seen her. ’Taint for myself I’m askin’ it—but just you let her
alone. Won’t you?”</p>

<p>Dennison had removed his pipe from his mouth for good
now. He stood staring angrily at the Rioba, whose clear,
dark eyes under their bushy brows were fixed with unwonted
brilliancy upon his own. The proprietor of the Cosmopolitan
burst into a rude laugh. “What’s the matter with the man?”
he ejaculated. Then returning the Rioba’s steadfast gaze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
with an equally pertinacious and meaning one, he answered
with much deliberateness, “Look-a-here, Rioba, I suppose I
<em>can</em> take a hint if I <em>must</em>—especially when it’s rammed down
into my skull as this one appears to be. You and me has got
along without trouble for ever since we come to Yellow Bear.
I should be sorry, very sorry, to be obleeged to have any
unpleasantness between us now. I always feel bound <em>to</em> have
unpleasantness with any man, partner or stranger, who interferes
with my own partic’ler concerns. Do you take?”</p>

<p>The Rioba made no direct reply. He stood with his eyes
bent upon the floor abstractedly. Nevertheless he “took.”
“Good-night, Dennison—good-night, ‘Mister,’” he suddenly
said, and turning abruptly upon his heel he quitted the Cosmopolitan
without another syllable.</p>

<p>The gray Nevada dawn was beginning to filter between
the sharp Sierra peaks. Yellow Bear looked like a sketch in
India-ink on gray paper. Around the corner of the Cosmopolitan
came a little procession not irreverently conveying
upon a shutter something over which a sheet had been loosely
spread. The air was raw and cold. “Careful—that’s it—steady
now,” cautioned Dennison in a low voice as they
mounted the Cosmopolitan doorstep. “Mister,” Rioba Jack,
Big Jinny, and Pearl Kate set down their burden at the upper
end of the dance-room. “Come gals, fly round,” exhorted
Dennison, “there’s all the bar to be set up across there—them
windows has got to be darkened up—there ain’t no
time to waste. ‘Mister’ and me’ll tend to our share of the
performance.” “I say, Jinny,” questioned the Rioba <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">sotto
voce</i> to that Paphian nymph a moment later, when Dennison
and “Mister” were engaged at a distance, “you left her
asleep, eh?” (There had, by the way, been no allusion from
either party concerned as to the embryo “unpleasantness”
of the preceding night—again to “Mister’s” secret regret).
“Sound, Jack—just like she was dead drunk,” responded Big
Jinny, cheerfully, pounding away with her hammer at the
window-sash. Her interrogator frowned. The answer somehow
gritted against his dormant sense of the fitting. Big
Jinny drove another tack and began to whistle.</p>

<p>A little later a magnificent eastern flare of pink and gold
fell through the one window yet undarkened upon the face of
Professor Jovanny, peacefully upturned from his last pillow—a
roll of his own thumbed dance-music wrapped about with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
white bar napkin. A moth-eaten knitted lap-robe was thrown
across his feet. Dressed in his one threadbare black suit—a
pile of his own music beneath the forlorn gray head—truly
here went one to the grave with all that he possessed—except
a daughter.</p>

<p>Dennison, the Rioba, “Mister” and the women stood for a
moment motionless beside the body—their tasks completed.</p>

<p>“A becomin’ caskit, altogether,” exclaimed the proprietor
of the Cosmopolitan, eyeing it critically.</p>

<p>“There’s somethin’ wanting all the same,” quoth “Mister,”
after the continued pause had grown oppressive.</p>

<p>“Wantin’,” retorted Dennison; “I’d like to know what it
is. Look at them there flags over the windows! Look at
that there bar, where all that a man’s got to do is to walk
up, after he’s paid his dollar, and help himself or let Pearl
and Jinny here help him! Look at this here coffin—solid
rosewood, round corners, carved legs and ag-graffe treble,”
he went on, with a grin at his own wit. “Come, now,
‘Mister,’ what more could Jovanny or anybody else want?”</p>

<p>But “Mister” was paying no attention to this sally or the
mirth it had provoked. “Flowers—flowers and fruit—fruit
and flowers,” he was muttering to himself, apparently confounding
a conventional Eastern attention from the friends
of an afflicted family with the catalogue of some Maine
county-fair. “Must come to the same thing—of course,” he
exclaimed, conclusively, striding away from the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de facto</i> coffin
and his companions. He disappeared within the barroom.
“I’ve made free with them new stores of yourn, Dennison,”
he called out presently, staggering down the room toward the
expectant party, weighted with an awkward load—two stems
of bananas and four spiky pineapples. “It won’t hurt
their sellin’,” he apologized, as with a dexterous balancing
and tying he disposed of the two first-named decorations
upright, one upon either side of poor Professor Jovanny’s
perpendicular feet—vegetable obelisks. A pineapple stood
upon each one of the “round corners.” Dennison and the
rest were hearty in commendations of their friend’s thoughtfulness
and taste. “That just fixes her off too slick!”
exclaimed Big Jinny, in high delight.</p>

<p>The sun mounted; the barkeeper appeared in the adjoining
room. First stragglers, curious to learn the truth of any
rumors concerning the day’s novelties at the Cosmopolitan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
strolled across the threshold. Dennison put “Mister” and a
table on which was deposited a loaded revolver and an empty
biscuit-tin, with a slit in its cover, over against the door;
Big Jinny and the Pearl, he posted at the special bar for the
day, which he had by no means ungenerously furnished forth;
himself, he stationed in an arm-chair, without the dance-room,
to advertise the obsequies, urge entrance into the penetralia
of the dance-room, as a matter of duty and pleasure,
and act as master of ceremonies generally.</p>

<p>It will be remarked that, designedly or accidentally, Rioba
Jack was appointed unto no prominent function in these
festivities of grief, so he dropped an eagle into “Mister’s”
resonant receptacle and walked out of the Cosmopolitan.
The street was sparsely peopled at that early hour. He
turned the corner of the hotel and halted abruptly to
avoid collision with a figure—a girl standing motionless,
and leaning against the wall, as if summoning up the courage
to advance further. What told the Rioba instantly
that it was Professor Jovanny’s daughter, was not difficult
to appreciate. The set young face, tear-stained and pallid,
but independent of a pair of dark, mournful eyes for its
beauty, the slender form not ungracefully draped by the
scanty, black-stuff dress; the head bared to the sharp morning
wind—it was a vignette of young grief, passive, despairing,
solitary, that the Rioba gazed at pityingly.</p>

<p>“Good—good-day,” he said, awkwardly. “You’re—his
gal, I take it. Can I—might I help you, Miss?” The last
word in respectful salute to the unmarried, weaker sex, had
been a stranger to the Rioba’s lips for a dozen years.</p>

<p>“I am going to my father,” the girl replied, in a curiously
abstracted fashion of speech; one wherein lay just a shadow
of foreign accent. She looked away from the Rioba’s clear
gaze, and continued, as if partly speaking to herself, “I
wish to see where they have put my father. I must sit by
him. He will need me.”</p>

<p>“But,” began the Rioba, in distressed perplexity, as she
wrapped her shawl closer about her exposed throat (it was a
beautiful throat), and made a motion to pass him, “yer
father’s dead, Miss. Poor, old Jovanny’s dead. He’s layin’ in
state in his pianny—coffin, I mean—round to the Cosmopolitan
here. You wouldn’t like to be a sittin’ alone there all day
’side the coffin, and everybody starin’ at you. ’Twouldn’t do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
“I want to sit by my father,” the girl answered more
decidedly. “Take me to him.”</p>

<p>The Rioba was mute. He saw that his new <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">protégée</i> (for
such he instinctively recognized her), was in that state of
mind that the eyes of all the universe were as naught to her.
Extremity of sorrow had taken hold upon her, and to reason
with her would be like reasoning with the clouded mind. He
looked again down upon her white, pathetic face. Its innocence
awoke a new emotion in the Rioba’s heart.</p>

<p>“Come along,” he ejaculated, not unkindly. He turned
and led the way to the Cosmopolitan. His companion followed
mutely with bowed head. The gathering crowd in
the dance-room stared as the two entered. The girl heeded
the whispers not a whit. She uttered a low exclamation and
walked quickly across to the “caskit.” “He is here, you
see,” she said slowly, half turning to the Rioba with a recognizing
smile whose transforming effect upon her wan face,
utterly obliterated from his mind any further sense of the
awkwardness of his position. Some one pushed a chair forward.
She seated herself beside the coffin and fixed her eyes
upon the marble face within it—a statue gazing upon a statue.
The room was hushed. Suddenly some human vermin, audibly
of the feminine gender, laughed from a far corner. The girl
raised her head and looked fixedly whence the sound had proceeded.
A troubled expression came over her countenance.
But at the same moment she caught sight of the Rioba standing
not distant, his face flushed with wrath at the insult, his
eyes brimming with compassion encountering her own. Some
shadowy, tardy sense of her utterly unprotected situation
must have tinged that brief look of hers with an unconscious
appeal. The effect upon the Rioba was electric. Leisurely
drawing his pistol from its belt, the stalwart cavalier of the
Sierras, whose education in chivalry had been intuitive,
stepped quietly toward the coffin of Professor Jovanny,
against the edge of which that loneliest of mourners had
rested her forehead. The Rioba laid his hand gently upon
her shoulder, and drew himself up. “Friends and feller-citizens,”
he said, running his eye comprehensively round the
room as he spoke, “this here young woman and this here
corpse is under <em>my</em> protection. Look at that there comb in
Big Jinny’s head!” Before any one in the room had discovered
the gaudy ornament in question it was smashed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
atoms by the bullet from the revolver discharged by the Rioba
as a period to his sentence. Big Jinny uttered one single
staccato screech (to which luxury she was certainly entitled),
not much relishing being made a target of; and then became
in common with the entire company, significantly silent.</p>

<p>Dennison’s startled face appeared at the door outside; he
had listened to speech and shot. The Rioba caught his eye
and smiled. It was a smile of wholesale defiance!</p>

<p>The morning wore on—noon came—afternoon. Professor
Jovanny’s “laying in state” had been, in the language of
“Mister,” “a big go.” Within its allotted limits of time,
wellnigh the entire male and female population of Yellow
Bear City had one by one entered the door of the Cosmopolitan
dance-room, contributed (so far as concerned the male
proportion), inspected, imbibed at discretion, departed. The
“heft” of “Mister’s” biscuit-tin was something to excite the
dormant cupidity of anyone. All day long that ill-sorted
pathetic tableau in the center of the place had remained
changeless—the voiceless, motionless watcher; the tranquil
tenant of that uncouth coffin; the Rioba standing beside
both, erect, attentive, grave. The room was scarcely entirely
still; even the Rioba had not expected that. There was
some shuffling of feet, subdued commenting and query. Big
Jinny and the Pearl exchanged pleasantries of a more or
less Doric character with passing acquaintances. Glasses
clinked and coin jingled. But no word, no ejaculation was
let fall that could reflect upon or annoy her who sat in the
midst of the staring, sluggishly revolving whirlpool. Big
Jinny had stuck sundry disconnected fragments of her unlucky
adornment in her ropy locks—a laconic hint. More than
once did some acquaintance offer to relieve the Rioba on
guard; but that gentleman only smiled and said, in an offhand
fashion, “I guess I’ll finish.”</p>

<p>Darkness had set in as the funeral procession took order
before the Cosmopolitan door. The majority of the sterner
sex in Yellow Bear seemed disposed to swell it. “Mister’s”
mule-cart preceded, whereon, amputated as to its legs and
with its cover nailed fast, was placed the coffin. Dennison
and “Mister” drove the hearse slowly. Immediately in its
rear walked, bareheaded still, and as walks the somnambulist,
Professor Jovanny’s daughter. The instant that the
Rioba had said, “You shall go with it,” she had not offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
to interfere with the shutting up, at last, from view of her
dead father’s body, or the removal of the dismembered piano
itself to the cart. The Rioba himself walked a pace to the
right, very much with the air of a young man who was dimly
aware that he was moving toward an emergency. A miscellaneous
crowd lengthened out in the rear. The pitchy flame
of the pine-wood torches filled the evening air and played
strange tricks with the tree shadows. Professor Jovanny’s
funeral <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cortège</i> began to get straggling and unsteady. In
fact the liberty of outside locomotion and potations of strong
waters had begun to battle against further decorum. Fragments
of ribald songs, unseemly pranks and hilarities broke
out behind intermittently. At one stage of the progress a
good part of the procession seceded to witness (and assist at)
the settlement of a “melancholy dispute for precedence
between two of Yellow Bear’s foremost citizens”—as their
obituaries in the next <i>Intelligencer</i> recorded. Nevertheless,
the cavernous hole dug for the reception of poor Professor
Jovanny, or, rather for his bulky sarcophagus, yawned at last
down a little declivity under a clump of firs.</p>

<p>“Dig her big enough for a hoss,” had been Dennison’s
prudential injunction to the “committee” of grave-diggers.
In their zeal they had excavated a pit that was fearful.
The crowd gathered about, holding up the torches. Dennison
and “Mister” superintended carefully the lowering of
the coffin, a feat accomplished not without difficulty. Yellow
Bear was, by this time, too weary of affliction, and, it is only
veracious to add, too inebriated to think of carrying out any
of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quasi</i> religious or municipal ceremonies discussed.
The first shovels of clay were discharged into the black
depth. Then all at once, with this most merciless of earthly
sounds suddenly breaking the stillness, the desolate mourner’s
soul awoke from its long lethargy to active grief. The girl
uttered an exceedingly bitter cry. “My father!—O God,
my father!” came from her white lips again and again,
interrupted by a tempest of sobs and tears under which she
bowed, crouching down upon the earth in an agony of loss
and loneliness. The Rioba stood with his head bent suspiciously
near to her side. Dennison stood opposite.</p>

<p>The crowd had dispersed before the work of “filling
in” was ended. The girl would not be moved until all was
over. Rioba Jack did not shift from his own station. At last,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
however, the shovels were thrown aside and the few men left,
beside the Rioba and Dennison, began relieving each other
of the torches, or collecting the tools.</p>

<p>“Come, my gal,” said the Rioba, with unconscious but
wondrous tenderness. The sound of his voice seemed to
give the kneeling one strength. She nodded her bowed head,
checked her sobs piteously and presently rose. Still keeping
her wet eyes averted from the flaring lights, she half-turned
toward him and—put out her hand.</p>

<p>The Rioba took it as if it had been an angel’s. Suddenly
Dennison, who had been the most attentive of spectators,
approached. The Rioba looked and discerned at his back,
holding a torch, the swart, greasy face of Mother Sal, whom
the other man had selected as consignee of the orphan.</p>

<p>“Look-a-here, Rioba,” exclaimed the proprietor of the
Cosmopolitan, abruptly, and standing squarely a couple of
yards in front of him, “it strikes me as it’s about time now
for you and me to turn over Jovanny’s gal here to one of her
own <em>sect</em>. She needs a mother’s care now—a mother’s, not a
father’s, except her own; nor yit a—a brother’s.”</p>

<p>The Rioba quite understood the situation. He changed
his position, looked Dennison squarely in the eye, and with
great coolness drew the young girl’s arm through his own—He
had settled upon this course of action while walking
with the procession. He baulked not. Pointing straight at
Mother Sal’s puffy, oily countenance, he ejaculated, “A
mother!” with ineffable scorn—and then added concisely:
“Dennison, I p’rpose to be responsible henceforth for this
here young woman. You are a liar—a thief—and—”</p>

<p>With a face whereon flashed out in a second all his pent-up
wrath Dennison brought his pistol from behind his back
and fired, but passion made his aim less true than that of the
unscathed Rioba; who, entirely on his guard to meet what
he had designedly provoked, fired almost simultaneously,
and laid Dennison dead at his feet.</p>

<p class="credit">(French of Lermina: E. C. Waggener: For Short Stories.)</p>

<p>More nervous than drunk, he closed and locked the door,
and by the light of a taper went to bed. Profound silence!
Then, on his ear-drums tinkled a sound, crystalline, swelling
to a vibration, like the notes of a hautboy interspersed with
trumpet calls. The pillow, too, rose and fell under his head,
sucking the brain like an exhauster, to eject it like a pump.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes. The light hushed the symphony;
constrained the pillow to immobility. The taper flickered
and leaped. Then, in the aureole of light, something black
appeared, big, sprawling, with great antennæ. Ugh! he
hated beasts! A beast? No. His arm hung from the bed;
it was the shadow of his hand he saw, thrown by the taper.
He turned on his back, seeing and not seeing; a misty film
stretching across the sclerotic like the nyctoloptic membrane
of birds. Fiery atoms danced in the darkness; his
palate like a stopper closed his throat and gummed it
with saliva. Then, in that obscurity, he was conscious of a
slow gliding. It was the door, which he had locked, opening
with wing-like sweeps, uncovering a hole long, narrow, always
broader, never longer, showing black and always blacker.</p>

<p>He stared, lips puffed, parched and parted. But from that
hole, that abyss of nothingness, nothing issued. He waited;
a locked door would never thus open without something coming!
He waited; still nothing; more and more feebly the
taper danced; soon it would fall, splutter, drown in oil. He
quickly decided. That something that did not come <em>should
not come</em>! Doubling like a serpent he slipped to the floor,
threw himself forward, seized, slammed the door, braced it
with one hand, turned the key with the other. It was done!
Breathless, panting, he returned to bed; not to sleep. His
hot skin pricked and stung him; that devilish symphony,
with the roar of a torrent, had recommenced. And that door,
which a second time he had closed, was a second time reopening,
swinging itself back like a vertical sepulchre. The wing-like
sweeps began anew; the black hole widened, blacker
always blacker, then—the taper fell, flashed, died to ember....</p>

<p>He was dead when they found him. The door? Both locked
and bolted; but neither lock nor bolt had caught the socket.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_22">AMONG THE AOULÂD NAÎEL</h2>
</div>

<p class="credit">(Algerian Sketches: Emile Masqueray: Le Figaro: Translated for
Short Stories by Eleanor Moore Hiestand.)</p>

<p>For two wearisome days I had been journeying back and
forth in the country of the Aoulâd Naîel. I was still far
from my tent when I threw myself prone upon the sands,
worn out with fatigue. On the previous afternoon, my guide
and I had made a little excursion to a neighboring <em>douar</em>, and
I could still hear echoes of the singular greetings showered
upon me by my entertainers:</p>

<p>“Our father! Thy tent is blessed! Thy spurs are strong!”</p>

<p>Suddenly, as I lay there, the clouds seemed to lower above
my head; they grew strangely dense and shone like brass.
The manes and tails of our horses bristled with apprehension.
I felt a prolonged shiver pass over me. A powerful hand
seemed to press its weight upon my temples. Now the frozen
sky was streaked with white; now it settled into oppressive
darkness again; and with no living thing in sight upon
the dry and barren plain, we felt utterly alone and at the
mercy of some awful power. Presently a veil seemed to be
thrown over our heads, and night came upon us as suddenly as
when a lamp is extinguished in an otherwise unlighted room.</p>

<p>My guide shouted. We leaped upon our horses who
galloped away with winged feet, trembling with fear, away
into the fathomless shadows. In vain I tried to check this
mad pace. I felt like throwing myself face downward upon
the ground, for I thought death awaited us in the saddle; but
my guide spurred on, quite oblivious of me, murmuring:</p>

<p>“There is no God! but God!”</p>

<p>A moment more and the clouds were cleft in twain with
an awful crash. The sky was spread with a sheet of darting
flame, and the earth became so bright that I saw quite plainly
the gray lizards crawling in a tuft of <em>chih</em>. Our horses
wheeled about, but we used our spurs, and, giving them the
rein, we fled on, not knowing whither we went. We were
quite beside ourselves; we no longer knew what danger it
was that lashed us on. My guide urged on my horse with a
hempen whip; I shouted to his. Again and again lurid
flashes of lightning diffused about as dazzling circles which we
traversed with a bound only to enter again into the terrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
darkness. How long had we been flying? How many
times had we barely escaped those awful thunderbolts? I
knew only that we sped like bullets till we struck suddenly
against a black cone which loomed up in our course.</p>

<p>Human cries rent the air, mingled with the howls of dogs.</p>

<p>We were trampling down somebody’s tent.</p>

<p>“Have a care, friend!” cried a voice from the darkness.
“Thou art welcome. I would that thy countenance were
known—that thou hadst come while it was yet day, but praised
be God who sent thee to thy servants to herald the rain.”</p>

<p>We leaped from our saddles and sprang under cover just in
time to escape a cascade from the clouds that would have
drenched our very bones.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>My host told me in the morning that he was about setting
out in company with all the men of the <em>douar</em> to meet a distinguished
<em>hadj</em> who had just made his third pilgrimage to
the Kaaba and Medina, one of the Brotherhood of Lidi-Abd-el-Kader-el-Djilani,
who was now regarded as almost a saint.</p>

<p>Upon their return, there was to be a festival. In the afternoon,
a banquet of cuckoos, several roast sheep and honey-cakes
would be served; this would be followed by target-practice
and dancing—that is, there would be dancing-girls
to entertain us. The tent occupied by these girls was in the
remotest part of the semi-circle which the <em>douar</em> described.
I could see it at a distance; the borders were drawn up and
something red showed from beneath.</p>

<p>I was talking to a youth who asked me in good faith
whether I believed in God and whether it were true that the
Europeans married their sisters. He was evidently studying
me as a kind of savage beyond the reach of Mohammed.
Several young women passed by us, bending beneath the
weight of black leathern bottles. The water glued their thin
robes to their skin. They wore no undergarments, and the
wind which tossed their torn clothing, revealed their whole
figures in clear profile. Some were bearing on their heads
bundles of briars which they steadied with their hands. Their
arms were long and well shaped; their throats had no voluptuous
fullness; their figures were almost straight up and
down. They looked to me like primitive caryatids of Asia.</p>

<p>My host had a daughter who was barely sixteen; his niece
was about twenty. These girls were eyeing me from afar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
and could not resist their curiosity to see and speak to the
<i>Roumi</i>, who was evidently bored by the youth talking to him.
Under the pretext of bringing me some water, they came up,
one behind the other. They looked very pretty with their
abundant hair intertwined with coral and their smooth cheeks
mingling the hues of amber and rose. The <i>Roumi</i> took the
bowl and drank with his eyes on his pretty servitors. As the
eldest seemed surprised at this impertinence, he apologized
for daring to drink in her presence, and, the ice being broken,
they chatted freely. They sank their dark eyes into the depths
of mine, and smiled till their beautiful teeth dazzled me.</p>

<p>“Why do you not cut off your moustache up to your lip?
Why don’t you shave half of your head? you look like a
monkey with all that hair falling over your face! Of what
kind of cloth are your clothes made? Let us see, please, how
it is sewed together. Did your wife make it? Tell us now—won’t
you?—if your wives look like us?”</p>

<p>The elder who plied all these questions was half reclining
in the sand, resting her body on her right hand and leaning
forward so as to gain my ear. I answered her with the first
lines of a song:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Thy eyes are black without kohol,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy cheeks are red without fard!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">She completed the stanza:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“’Tis thou who hast given me the fever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou who hast hurled me upon the mountain!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Then she turned her face toward the furthest tent, through
whose lifted borders something red shone, and said, abruptly:</p>

<p>“Dost thou know Khamissa?”</p>

<p>“What Khamissa?”</p>

<p>“The dancer.”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Then give us something right away, because, as soon as
thou hast seen her, thy heart will burn itself out, and then
wilt thou have nothing to do with us!”</p>

<p>I had in my pocket a little mirror which I gave her. The
younger girl took my silk handkerchief and begged also for
a red girdle I wore. So they plundered me outright—the
little savages—and I was obliged to smile.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, some shots were heard; sharp you-yous
echoed along the line of the tents. The <em>hadj</em> was
approaching from the depth of a ravine. There were at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
thirty cavaliers attending him, all mounted on spirited horses
which galloped over the brow of the hill, their tails flying.
More than one of these horsemen wore only a shirt, a shabby
sort of a burnous over his shoulders, a rag twisted around
his head, and was mounted on a wooden saddle with no
covering, and only two ends of rope for a bridle! I cannot
describe the effect as they came riding over the hill, their
bronzed legs pressing the flanks of their steeds. What a superb
poverty it was! What wonderful bandits these men were!</p>

<p>The holy pilgrim permitted himself to be borne on a mule’s
back. His eyes were half closed, his cheeks looked pale
beneath a large turban of white muslin. He trembled a little
as he set foot upon the ground, and still more when he seated
himself in the midst of a group of young people, who looked
at him with profound awe. I suggested giving him some
quinine, but I was informed that it was the fear of God which
caused him to tremble; the <em>hadj</em> thanked me with a glance
which said I was only a pagan, or else I was a terrible blunderer!
The women of the <em>douar</em> had hidden themselves. They
dared not appear before this holy man, perhaps for fear his
sanctity should suffer. Angels have fallen for love of women.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Powder was flashing from noonday till sunset. The women
emerged from their tents, clad in their best. They wore long
veils, white or flowered, which fell from the summit of their
lofty head-dresses to the ground. Their faces were uncovered
and quite brilliant with ochre and vermillion. The
horses went prancing by them, and the cavaliers, in their
honor, rode so close that the flaming wads from their guns
burned the women’s red robes. They were intoxicated by
the acid odor of smoke, they cried out like birds of prey, but
kept waving handkerchiefs in the air. A cavalier seized one
and galloped away with it. Several shots were fired after him
across the plain. He wheeled about and rode back to his
elected mistress. We grew excited. A breath of anger and
combat blew over us, but, at a sign from the senior cavalier,
every gun was discharged at once, and the noise of this
fusillade rose to the very skies. It was not long ere we
were gathered around the roast sheep, whose savory flanks
were decorated with gold, white cuckoos surmounted by pats
of butter and bathed in red sauce. We praised God and their
was no one who complained of being slighted. The holy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
pilgrim was not with us. The wife of my host had served
him apart with a young lamb, a huge bowl of sour milk, a
fine cake of dates and semoule. Several piles of shining
pieces were also given him in a kerchief and he was now
reciting his litanies in honor of God and of his patron, dead
to all the world but living in celestial councils, Sidi-Aba-el-Kader-el-Ghilâni-el-Baghdâdi.
Khamissa had not yet shown
herself. Only her two companions, Fatma and Zeineb
appeared. They wore blue robes and golden diadems. They
said that Khamissa must be either ill or praying.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>At last the moon rose and in the open space in the center
of the <em>douar</em>, I saw some tapers placed in parallel lines forming
a sort of avenue of light. On either side the women
scooped out little holes in the sand, and executed a few
dancing steps. The men squatted alongside of the rows of
tapers, but the women stood in the background, looking like
dark phantoms. I sat with my host and some persons of
distinction at the end and in the middle of the road.
Opposite us sat Fatma and Zeineb, half-reclining in a group
of halfa; beyond them a royal profile was visible. It was
she! The words I had heard in the morning rang in my
ears: “Thy heart will be burnt out!” Already the fires
kindled as I looked at her. The flutes discoursed a tender
strain. Zenieb and Fatma were whirling about each other,
blue as the sky, shining with golden stars. Only in the
shadow could I see her form outlined softly beneath the
folds of a great piece of white silk which enveloped her.</p>

<p>What said the flutes now? The space was empty. The
crackling briars shot flames up higher than the tents. The flutes
called with imperious vibrating accents, in sad supplications,
in wild outbursts, while the dull thud of the drums in the
interval seemed to fire the soul with a holy enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Khamissa lifted her arms, tossed aside the haïk which
enveloped her and slowly rose. She took several steps and
then paused, her elbows pressed to her sides, her two hands
folded against her cheeks, her head inclining somewhat to
the left, her eyes half-closed—it was the attitude of prayer.
She sparkled from head to foot, and, in her attitude of absolute
repose, she looked like a splendid idol.</p>

<p>Her robes were of red, silver and gold. The scarlet
drapery, cunningly drawn about her in thick folds, reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
all the way to the ground. A belt of embossed silver, high
under the breasts but low at the sides, encompassed her like
a piece of armor. Upon her bosom lay numerous golden
chains dependant from both sides of her head, which was
crowned by a lofty headdress. This coiffure was made of a
black silk turban and tresses of wool, over which were worn
two diadems of gold with pendants that twinkled upon her
forehead. A long white veil parted at her temples and fell
backward over her shoulders to the ground. Neither her
hair nor her ears nor her neck were visible. The perfect oval
of her face, her beautiful cheeks and her long eyes were
framed in gold. Her lips were painted red, her cheeks
were touched with saffron and with rose, her eyelids were
colored blue. It was only when she held out her arms that I
saw the velvet whiteness of her flesh, and yet these arms
were laden to the elbows with huge bracelets of silver that
bristled with points.</p>

<p>Was it Pallas-Athene? Was it a Byzantine madonna?
Was it a painted statue from the Acropolis? Who was this
coming toward us with slow steps that glided softly over the
sand keeping time with the thunder of the gongs and the
wild flutes that rent the air? She swayed gently and turned
her hands reddened with henna, now holding her head to the
right while her wide-open eyes shone like stars. Her tall
and supple body was invisible, but its movements communicated
a divine grace and harmony to the garments she wore.
She swayed to and fro by an insensible movement. To the
young men who gazed upon her, she seemed a goddess! She
advanced in this way till she stood within a few steps of my
fascinated eyes; then she paused and fell back into her first
attitude, the pose of a Virgin in a cathedral window. I watched
her deliberately. The pendant of her diadems were golden
fish, the symbols of Jesus Christ, our Saviour; in the center
of her forehead hung the Christian cross; on her chin which
was sculptured out of purest marble, the cross of Buddha lay;
on her blood-colored hands were the seven darts of Solomon’s
candlestick; around her thumbs were two blue threads, the
Egyptian symbol of eternal life. This marvelous creature
was unconsciously consecrated to all religions of the world.</p>

<p>She turned about to retire as slowly as she had advanced.
Her long white veil trailed on the ground. Then she came
back with a new rhythm in her movements, yet still gliding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
quickly, softly, subtly like a ray of sunlight. Her steps were
longer now. Her lips parted in a charming smile; her head
was half-turned to one side; now the right, now the left
arm was extended to give a playful little tap to some lover or
adorer as she advanced in the midst of beseeching shadows.
Again she paused before the group of which I was a part,
turned with suspended motion and then retreated. As yet
not an Arab had stirred. They were squatting there with
their knees pressed against their chins, half-hidden by their
barnous. When she advanced for the third time, the
scene changed. Then she was truly superb!</p>

<p>“O, Heaven! Wonderful! May God bless thy mother!
God keep misery from all who belong to thee!”</p>

<p>Thus the men exclaimed as they pressed each other for a
better view, and the women stifled the <em>you-yous</em> in their
throats, pressing their hands to their eyes.</p>

<p>With a backward motion, she drew off her veil; a quick
movement unfastened the first row of chains from her breast.
She turned her head, spread her arms in a semi-circle, bent
her round bust upon her body, and, as though inspired by the
beating of the drums, she tapped the earth with her naked
feet. She came forward with a simple movement, with no
seductive oscillation of the body, yet perfectly intoxicating!
Her eyes shot sparks which fell to her very ankles where
circlets of gold were flashing. It would not have surprised me,
had some one of the young brigands who watched her,
snatched her up in his iron grasp, swung her into his saddle
and galloped away. But they seemed content simply to foreswear
and ruin themselves for her. They tossed under her
feet every bit of silver the holy pilgrim had left them; the
sand shone with coins—five franc pieces, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">boudjous</i> of
Tunis, and old Spanish <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">douros</i>. Now and then, she would
pause and start anew, smiling more radiantly each time she
threw out her arms. I shut my eyes for a moment; I felt
she was before me. I saw her kneeling, her breast swelling
beneath the golden chains, raising her blue eyelids, showing
her white teeth set in coral. I leaned toward her; I felt her
warm breath fan my cheek. I laid three gold pieces on
her brow and one on either cheek.</p>

<p>“Khamissa!” I murmured. “Lovely one! Leave me not!”</p>

<p>She smiled her alluring smile. The flutes burst forth in a
passionate appeal. I held out my arms, but she was gone!</p>

<p>She was not a pretty sight ... an old woman tottering under
sixty years of poverty ... and now was the worst poverty of
all. Her hand, which gathered a grimy plaid shawl at her
throat, trembled ceaselessly from privation, and the vile liquor
privation had brought. She was hungry; it seemed to her that
she had never eaten. She was cold; it seemed to her that she
had never known warmth.</p>

<p>She crept into a little hallway on the water front. The
breeze from the river was not a strong one; but to her it
was a hurricane. The drizzling rain hurt her. The minor
tones of a bell from a ship at the near-by docks told that it
was midnight. With inarticulate moans she crouched down
in a corner, closing the door to keep out the wind and rain.</p>

<p>Something was in the corner, she felt it with her benumbed
hands. It was soft and warm to her touch. A plaintive
mew followed. The something was a cat. At first she rather
resented its presence. Then she gathered it up in her arms
and pressed it against the bosom of her ragged old dress.
Here was a creature as miserable as she. It was only a cat,
but she felt less lonely with it in her arms. When she had
been a little girl she had had a pet kitten.</p>

<p>Each was cold—the cat and the woman—but each found
some warmth in the other. The cat stopped mewing and
the woman stopped moaning. The wind had shifted and the
rain had ceased. The door swung open again and the moon
hanging calmly beautiful among the clouds, shone through
the tangle of masts and cordage and into the hallway.</p>

<p>The woman, crouched in the corner, held the cat as she
would have held a child. By-and-by she began to rock
slowly to and fro. The clouds drifted away, and the stars
joined the moon in peeping through the door.</p>

<p>The woman’s eyes were closed and she was crooning an
old-fashioned lullaby. The cat was very faintly purring and
one of its paws rested on her bare neck. The moon sank
slowly out of sight and new clouds obscured the stars.</p>

<p>When the policeman peered in the hallway just before daybreak,
the woman and the cat were asleep.</p>

<p>And they are still sleeping.</p>

<p>Little Timmy Mulligan was very sick. Some of his chums
said in an awed whisper: “He is dyin’ dis time, sure pop.”</p>

<p>No more would his 9-year-old war-whoop resound around
the corner. No more would the lake front know Timmy, his
bare feet, and his stone bruises. Never again would he
occupy the pitcher’s box and captain the “Red Hots, de
champeens uv all de 9-year-olds on de wes’-side”—a nine
which, through Capt. Timmy’s masterly inshoots, had attained
proud preëminence. Never again would Timmy refresh his
jaded spirits by throwing rocks at the Italian on the corner,
who had incurred his enmity by once refusing him a banana.</p>

<p>Timmy was as sturdy a youngster as ever the west side
turned out; he was as manly and self-reliant as the average
Chicago 9-year-old. He was the cock of the walk among all
his companions—the best swimmer, the best fighter, and the
best pitcher in the ward. The neighborhood was lonesome
without Timmy. People could not imagine “what was on the
boy,” once so hearty and vigorous, to keep to his bed.</p>

<p>The little invalid lay stretched out on his couch as flat and
as pallid as a pancake, in the front room away up in Sylvester
Mulligan’s ten-story flat building. The neighbors were
coming in droves to cheer up the ailing youngster.</p>

<p>“You’re not goan to lave me, yer poor ould mither, are
ye, Timmy asthore?” wailed his mother, rocking from side
to side in her frenzy of grief, like a ship in a storm, her voice
choked with grief, her eyes drowned in tears.</p>

<p>“Ye were allus a dutiful child to me, Timmy alanna, and
ye wud not be afther lavin’ yer poor old mither to fight the
wurld alone, now wud ye? You’re the only boy I have left,
Timmy, and ye’ll not lave me now afther raisin’ ye as long
as I have. Sphake to him, Father Murphy; plase do, yer
Rivirince—he’ll moind you; he wuz allus a good-hearted boy,
though a thrifle wild. Rayson wid him, father; the fayver
has rached his brain, and he turns his face to the wall from
me. He won’t sphake to me. Oh, it’s heart-scalded I am!”</p>

<p>“What’s this I hear, Timmy, about your talking of dying,”
cheerfully sung out the good Father Murphy, approaching the
bedside of the little sufferer, and taking the boy’s wasted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
hand in his own. “Why, your worth a dozen dead men, yet.
I could never spare you in the world. Who could I put in
your place as monitor in the school; who else could I get
to run my errands and to bring me my Evening News, eh?
Why, Timmy, my boy, you are indispensable to the parish—you’re
a little pillar of the church—all by yourself. You’re
only pretending to be sick—you who were always so strong
and hearty, with the rosiest cheeks and the brightest eye of
all the lads for squares around. Brace up, and leave all
thoughts of dying to old folks like your mother and myself.
Do you hear, Tim?”</p>

<p>Tim did hear, nodding his head feverishly upon his clammy
pillow. His eyes burned with an unnatural fire. They had
the appealing glance of a wounded deer; it would melt your
heart but to look at them.</p>

<p>The little invalid tossed uneasily upon the bed; his curling
hair, damp with perspiration and pain, strayed uneasily o’er
the pillow; his thin hands beat the coverlid with the petulance
of a sturdy youngster unused to such close confinement.
Yet he spoke not a word.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you a word for your old teacher, Tim, my boy?”
asked Father Murphy, softly.</p>

<p>“Where’s Corkey O’Neill?” yelled out Timmy, suddenly,
heedless of the worthy priest’s entreaty. “I wanter see
Corkey; bring ’im up ’ere immejiate.”</p>

<p>Corkey was instantly produced, shuffling shamefacedly
across the room to the bedside of his stricken comrade.
Tim’s brow was knitted in meditation. His fingers played a
tattoo on the blanket. He had a load on his mind he wanted
to dump. Turning restlessly, he unburdened himself thus:</p>

<p>“I done ye up two weeks ter day, Corkey.”</p>

<p>Corkey admitted the “doing up.”</p>

<p>“But I fout ye fair, Corkey; I didn’t use brass knuckles?”</p>

<p>Corkey was forced to declare that brass knuckles took no
active part in the youthful encounter.</p>

<p>“Ye sed I wuz a ’snide,’ Corkey, didn’t ye?”</p>

<p>It appeared that Corkey had said so.</p>

<p>“I t’umped ye pretty hard. I blacked both o’ yer eyes—or
wuz it ony one?”</p>

<p>It was “ony one,” for Corkey still bore the echo of it on
his tinted left optic.</p>

<p>“Well, wot I wanter say, Corkey, is I’m sorry I bunged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
you up so bad. I don’t believe I could whip you the way I
am here, but ef you want satisfaction ye can take it out o’ me
now—if you bear enny hard feelings.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t hit a dying kid, not fur de hull west side,”
cried out Corkey, sobbing as if his heart would break, “ye
only guv me wot I deserved, Timmy; I had no right roastin’
you de way I did.”</p>

<p>“Who duz the Red Hots play a Sunday?”</p>

<p>“We wuz a goan to play de Hard Times, Timmy, but now
dat you’re sick an’ can’t pitch we’ve declared the match off—we’d
git skunked.”</p>

<p>“Wot did ye do dat for?” savagely exclaimed Timmy.
“I’ve a good mind to black yer other eye for ye.”</p>

<p>“Well, we all made up we wudn’t play till ye got well, Tim;
it’s no use going out on de dimund unless you’re pitchin’.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mulligan appeared to see matters in the proper light.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you’re about right, Corkey,” he was moved
to admit. “I guess I’ll hav ter get well. I wanter skunk
dat crowd of Hard Times wid me in-shoots and me new snake
curve that I’ve been studying out here the last two weeks
while I’ve been rastlin’ wid de blankets. Wot duz de gang
say about me, Corkey, layin’ here in me bed on the flat o’ me
back, like an old granny—me who wuz never sick before?”</p>

<p>“Say, Tim, dey’re orful sorry; they’d cum up here themselves
to see ye, ony yer ole ’ooman wudn’t let ’em.”</p>

<p>“Stick yer hed out uv the windy and yell for ’em to come
up,” commanded the prostrate pitcher.</p>

<p>Corkey thrust his Bulwer Lytton brow out of the window
emitting a yell that caused all the members of the Red Hots
to file into the room on tiptoe, wiping their mouths with their
coat sleeves, and hanging their heads.</p>

<p>“Hello, fellers!”</p>

<p>“Hello, Tim!”</p>

<p>“Wot’s de matter wid ye, Philly Burke? Wot are ye
snivellin’ for? Didn’t ye ever see a sick kid before? An’
you, too, Patsy Carroll—why, I nivir see sich weakeners
as you kids before in all me life. You’re a nice gang to let
yourself be bluffed by them Hard Times crowd. Ye have no
more sand in yer craw than a chicken. I’ve a good notion to
sick me poodle on de hull gang o’ ye. Cum up yere, Danger!”</p>

<p>The little black-and-tan that had retreated under the
bureau, where he kept up growling and showing his teeth at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
the crowd of strange visitors, jumped up on the bed and
began licking his youthful master’s hand. Then, turning
round, he glared fiercely at the roomful of sympathizers, his
tail lashing the bed, his little black nose uplifted defiantly.
He showed his teeth in a subdued and dangerous snarl, as if
looking out for the shins of the undertaker. All through
little Tim’s sickness the dog had hung around his master’s
room in a subdued and listless manner. When not squatting
on the sick boy’s pillow, licking Tim’s hot and feverish hand,
and vigilantly guarding his restless slumber, the dog would
slink away under the bed, as if the boy’s illness had affected
him, also, and had cowed his honest bark and native pluck
into a cowardly snarling and showing of his vicious teeth.</p>

<p>“If that dood of a doctor comes a-monkeying around
here enny more a-pizening me with the medicines he makes
me swaller, we’ll giv him hydrophoby—won’t we, Danger?”</p>

<p>Danger showed his red gums in fierce assent.</p>

<p>“Where’s me ould woman?”</p>

<p>“Here I am, Timmy asthore; what is it?”</p>

<p>“Sind out the kittle for a quart o’ beer. I wanter do the
right thing and treat de gang as has called on me. I guess
it’ll be about square. Whin ye go over with the growler to
Danny Shay’s, Corkey, mind ye scoop in all the free lunch as
ye can crib. I guess I could go a little cheese sandwich
meself. Be sure you tell Danny Shay to pack the growler as
tight as he can, Corkey,” was the latter part of the languid yet
hospitable injunction of the stricken Timmy, as he turned
over on his side for a refreshing slumber, the vigilant Danger
snugly perched on his fifth rib.</p>

<p>Mr. Mulligan, I am pleased to state, recovered in time to
give the Hard Times the worst skunking they ever got.</p>

<p>In that match, digging his toenails in the pitcher’s box, his
cap cocked rakishly over his left eye, and Danger coaching
“on de side” and howling like a demon when his master
struck out any of the opposing batsmen, Timmy ladled out
to the demoralized Hard Times those justly celebrated curves
of his, reinforced with the famous snake shoot which he had
acquired while tossing oranges on a feverish bed.</p>

<p>Timmy was carried home to the 19th ward in triumph,
Danger bringing up the rear, leaving in his trail the vibrating
air churned to a white heat by his wagging tail.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_25">THE GOBLIN BARBER</h2>
</div>

<p class="credit"><i>Famous Stories—The Old-time Favorites</i></p>

<p class="credit j">(By Johann Musäus. This writer, little known save to scholars, enjoyed
a great reputation during his life—1733 to 1787—as a collector of his native
folk lore. The Goblin Barber is founded on an old German legend. Franz
Melcherson, a good-for-nothing, squanders a fortune; becomes beggared;
falls in love with his landlady’s daughter, Meta; tramps to Antwerp to
recover money due him; fails to collect, and on his way back asks shelter at an
inn; is refused; curses the landlord, who, to be revenged, calls him back and
lodges him in the haunted castle where the incidents of this story befall him.)</p>

<p>The castle lay hard by the hamlet, on a steep rock, right
opposite the inn, from which it was divided merely by the
highway and a little gurgling brook. The situation being so
agreeable, the edifice was still kept in repair, and well provided
with all sorts of house-gear; for it served the owner as a
hunting-lodge, where he frequently caroused all day; and so
soon as the stars began to twinkle in the sky, retired with his
whole retinue, to escape the mischief of the ghost, who rioted
about in it the whole night over, but by day gave no disturbance.
Unpleasant as the owner felt this spoiling of his
mansion by a bugbear, the nocturnal sprite was not without
advantages, for the great security it gave from thieves. The
count could have appointed no trustier or more watchful
keeper over the castle than this same spectre, for the rashest
troop of robbers never ventured to approach this old tower
in the hamlet of Rummelsburg, near Rheinberg.</p>

<p>The sunshine had sunk, the dark night was coming heavily
on, when Franz, with a lantern in his hand, proceeded to the
castle-gate, under the guidance of mine host, who carried in
his hand a basket of victuals, with a flask of wine, which he
said should not be marked against him. He had also taken
along with him a pair of candlesticks and two wax-lights; for
in the whole castle there was neither lamp nor taper, as no
one ever stayed in it after twilight. On the way, Franz
noticed the creaking, heavy-laden basket, and the wax-lights,
which he thought he should not need, and yet must pay for.
Therefore he said: “What is this superfluity and waste, as at
a banquet? The light in the lantern is enough to see with
till I go to bed; and when I awake the sun will be high
enough, for I am tired, and shall sleep with both eyes.”</p>

<p>“I will not hide from you,” replied the landlord, “that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
story runs of there being mischief in the castle, and a goblin
that frequents it. You, however, need not let the thing disturb
you; we are near enough, you see, for you to call us;
should you meet with aught unnatural I and my folks will
be at your hand in a twinkling to assist you. Down in the
house there we keep astir all night through, some one is
always moving. I have lived here these thirty years, yet I
cannot say that I have ever seen aught. If there be now and
then a little hurly-burlying at nights, it is nothing but cats
and martens rummaging about the granary. As a precaution
I have provided you with candles; the night is no friend of
man; and the tapers are consecrated, so that sprites, if
there be such in the castle, will avoid their shine.”</p>

<p>It was no lying in mine host to say that he had never seen
anything of spectres in the castle; for by night he had taken
special care not once to set foot in it; and by day, the goblin
did not come to sight. In the present case, too, the traitor
would not risk himself across the border. After opening the
door he handed Franz the basket, directed him what way to
go, and wished him good-night. Franz entered the lobby
without anxiety or fear, believing the ghost story to be empty
tattle, or a tradition of some real occurrence in the place,
which idle fancy had shaped into an unnatural adventure.
He had laid it down as a rule deduced from experiences,
when he heard any rumor, to believe exactly the reverse, and
left the grain of truth which, in the opinion of the wise
knight, always lies in such reports, entirely out of sight.</p>

<p>Pursuant to mine host’s direction, he ascended the winding
stone stair; and reached a bolted door, which he opened with
his key. A long, dark gallery, where his footsteps resounded,
led him into a large hall, and from this, a side-door, into a
suite of apartments, richly provided with all furniture for
decoration or convenience. Out of these he chose the room
which had the friendliest aspect, where he found a well-pillowed
bed, and from the window could look right down
upon the inn, and catch every loud word that was spoken there.
He lit his wax-tapers, furnished his table, and feasted with
the commodiousness and relish of an Otaheitean noble. The
big-bellied flask was an antidote to thirst. So long as his
teeth were in full occupation, he had no time to think of the
reported devilry in the castle. If aught now and then made
a stir in the distance, and Fear called to him, “Hark! hark!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
There comes the goblin;” Courage answered: “Stuff! it is
cats and martens bickering and caterwauling.” But in the
digestive half-hour after meat, when the sixth sense, that of
hunger and thirst, no longer occupied the soul, she directed
her attention from the other five exclusively upon the sense
of hearing; and already Fear was whispering three timid
thoughts into the listener’s ear, before Courage had time to
answer once.</p>

<p>As the first resource, he locked the door, bolted it, and
made his retreat to the walled seat in the vault of the window.
He opened this, and to dissipate his thoughts a little,
looked out on the spangled sky, gazed at the corroded moon,
and counted how often the stars snuffed themselves. On the
road beneath him all was void; and in spite of the pretended
nightly bustle in the inn, the doors were shut, the lights out,
and everything as still as in a sepulchre. On the other hand,
the watchman blew his horn, making his “List, gentlemen!”
sound over all the hamlet; and for the composure of the
timorous astronomer, who still kept feasting his eyes on the
splendor of the stars, uplifted a rusty evening hymn right
under his window; so that Franz might easily have carried
on a conversation with him, which, for the sake of company,
he would willingly have done, had he in the least expected
that the watchman would make answer to him.</p>

<p>In a populous city, in the middle of a numerous household,
where there is a hubbub equal to that of a bee-hive, it may
form a pleasant entertainment for the thinker to philosophize
on solitude, to decorate her as the loveliest playmate of the
human spirit, to view her under all her advantageous aspects,
and long for her enjoyment as for hidden treasure. But in
scenes where she is no exotic, in the isle of Juan Fernandez,
where a solitary eremite, escaped from shipwreck, lives with
her through long years; or in the dreary nighttime, in a
deep wood, or in an old uninhabited castle, where empty walls
and vaults awaken horror, and nothing breathes of life but
the moping owl in the ruinous turret; there, in good sooth,
she is not the most agreeable companion for the timid anchorite
that has to pass his time in her abode, especially if he is
every moment looking for the entrance of a spectre to augment
the party. In such a case it may easily chance that a
window conversation with the watchman shall afford a richer
entertainment for the spirit and the heart, than a reading of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
the most attractive eulogy on solitude. If Ritter Zimmerman
had been in Franz’s place, in the castle of Rummelsburg, on
the Westphalian marches, he would doubtless in this position
have struck out the fundamental topics of as interesting a
treatise on <em>Society</em>, as, inspired to all appearances by the irksomeness
of some ceremonious assembly, he has poured out
from the fullness of his heart in praise of <em>Solitude</em>.</p>

<p>Midnight is the hour at which the world of spirits acquires
activity and life, when hebetated animal nature lies entombed
in deep slumber. Franz inclined getting through this critical
hour in sleep rather than awake; so he closed his window,
went the round of his rooms once more, spying every nook
and crevice, to see whether all was safe and earthly; snuffed
the lights to make them burn clearer; and without undressing
or delaying, threw himself upon his bed, with which his
wearied person felt unusual satisfaction. Yet he could not
get asleep so fast as he wished. A slight palpitation at the
heart, which he ascribed to a tumult in the blood, arising
from the sultriness of the day, kept him waking for a while;
and he failed not to employ this respite in offering up such a
pithy prayer as he had not prayed for many years. This produced
the usual effect, and he softly fell asleep while saying it.</p>

<p>After about an hour, as he supposed, he started up with a
sudden terror; a thing not at all surprising when there is
tumult in the blood. He was broad awake; he listened
whether all was quiet, and heard nothing but the clock strike
twelve; a piece of news which the watchman forthwith communicated
to the hamlet in doleful recitative. Franz listened
for a while, turned on the other side, and was again about to
sleep, when he caught, as it were, the sound of a door grating
in the distance, and immediately it shut with a stifled
bang. “Alack! alack!” bawled Fright into his ear; “this
is the ghost in very deed!” “’Tis nothing but the wind,”
said Courage manfully. But quickly it came nearer, nearer,
like the sound of heavy footsteps. Clink here, clink there,
as if a criminal were rattling his irons, or as if the porter
were walking about the castle with his bunch of keys. Alas,
here was no wind business! Courage held his peace; and
quaking Fear drove all the blood to the heart, and made it
thump like a smith’s forehammer.</p>

<p>The thing was now beyond jesting. If Fear would still
have let Courage get a word, the latter would have put the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
terror-struck watcher in mind of his subsidiary treaty with
mine host, and incited him to claim the stipulated assistance
loudly from the window; but for this there was a want of
proper resolution. The quaking Franz had recourse to the
bedclothes, the last fortress of the timorous, and drew them
close over his ears, as bird-ostrich sticks his head in the grass
when he can no longer escape the huntsman. Outside it
came along, door up, door to, with hideous uproar; and at
last it reached the bedroom. It jerked sharply at the lock,
tried several keys till it found the right one; yet the bar still
held the door, till a bounce like a thunderclap made bolt and
rivet start, and threw it wide open. Now stalked in a long,
lean man, with a black beard, in ancient garb, and with a
gloomy countenance, his eyebrows hanging down in deep
earnestness from his brow. Over his right shoulder he had a
scarlet cloak, and on his head he wore a peaked hat. With
a heavy step he walked thrice in silence up and down the
chamber; looked at the consecrated tapers, and snuffed them
that they might burn brighter. Then he drew aside his
cloak, girded on a scissor pouch which he had under it, produced
a set of shaving tackle, and immediately began to whet
a sharp razor on the broad strap which he wore at his girdle.</p>

<p>Franz perspired in mortal agony under his coverlet;
recommended himself to the keeping of the Virgin; and
anxiously speculated on the object of this manœuvre, not
knowing whether it was meant for his throat or his beard.
To his comfort, the goblin poured some water from a silver
flask into a basin of silver, and with his skinny hand lathered
the soap into a light foam; then set a chair, and beckoned
with a solemn look to the quaking looker-on to come forth
from among the quivering bedclothes.</p>

<p>Against so pertinent a sign remonstrance was as bootless
as against the rigorous commands of the Grand Turk when
he transmits an exiled vizier to the angel of death, the
Capichi Bashi with the silken cord, to take delivery of his
head. The most rational procedure that can be adopted in
this critical case is to comply with necessity, put a good face
on a bad business, and with stoical composure let one’s throat
be noosed. Franz honored the spectre’s order; the coverlet
began to move, he sprang sharply from his couch, and took
the place pointed out to him. However strange this quick
transition from the uttermost terror to the boldest resolution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
may appear, I doubt not but Moritz in his <i>Psychological
Journal</i> could explain the matter till it seemed quite natural.</p>

<p>Immediately the goblin barber tied the towel about the
shivering customer, seized the comb and scissors, and clipped
off his hair and beard. Then he soaped him scientifically;
first the beard, next the eyebrows, at last the temples and the
hind-head; and shaved him from throat to nape, as smooth
and bald as a death’s-head. This operation finished, he
washed his head, dried it clean, made his bow, and buttoned
up his scissor pouch, wrapped himself in his scarlet mantle,
and made for departing. The consecrated tapers had burned
with an exquisite brightness through the whole transaction;
and Franz, by the light of them, perceived in the mirror that
the shaver had changed him into a Chinese pagoda. In secret
he heartily deplored the loss of his fair brown locks; yet took
fresh breath as he observed that with this sacrifice the account
was settled, and the ghost had no more power over him.</p>

<p>So it was in fact; Redcloak went toward the door, silently
as he had entered, without salutation or good-bye, and seemed
entirely the contrast of his talkative guild-brethern. But
scarcely was he gone three steps when he paused, looked
round with a mournful expression at his well-served customer,
and stroked the flat of his hand over his black, bushy beard.
He did the same a second time, and again just as he was in
the act of stepping out at the door. A thought struck Franz
that the spectre wanted something, and a rapid combination
of ideas suggested that perhaps he was expecting the very
service he himself had just performed.</p>

<p>As the ghost, notwithstanding his rueful look, seemed more
disposed for banter than for seriousness, and had played his
guest a scurvy trick—not done him any real injury, the panic
of the latter had now almost subsided. So he ventured the
experiment, and beckoned to the ghost to take the seat from
which he had himself just risen. The goblin instantly obeyed,
threw off his coat, laid his barber tackle on the table, and
placed himself in the chair, in the posture of a man that wishes
to be shaved. Franz carefully observed the same procedure
which the spectre had observed to him; clipped his beard with
the scissors, cropped away his hair, lathered his whole scalp,
and the ghost all the while sat steady as a wig-block. The
awkward journeyman came ill at handling the razor; he had
never had another in his hand, and he shore the beard right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
against the grain, whereat the goblin made as strange grimaces
as Erasmus’s ape when imitating its master’s shaving. Nor
was the unpracticed bungler himself well at ease, and he
thought more than once of the sage aphorism, “What is not
thy trade make not thy business;” yet he struggled through
the task the best way he could, and scraped the ghost as bald
as he himself had been scraped.</p>

<p>Hitherto the scene between the spectre and the traveler
had been played pantomimically; the action now became
dramatic. “Stranger,” said the ghost, “accept my thanks
for the service thou hast done me. By thee I am delivered
from the long imprisonment which has chained me for three
hundred years within these walls, to which my departed soul
was doomed, till a mortal hand should consent to retaliate on
me what I practiced on others in my lifetime.</p>

<p>“Know that of old a reckless scorner dwelt within this
tower, who took his sport on priests as well as laics. Count
Hardman, such his name, was no philanthropist, acknowledged
no superior, and no law, but practiced vain caprice and
waggery, regarding not the sacredness of hospitable rights;
the wanderer who came beneath his roof, the needy man who
asked a charitable alms of him, he never sent away unvisited
by wicked joke. I was his castle barber, still a willing
instrument, and did whatever pleased him. Many a pious
pilgrim, journeying past us, I allured with friendly speeches
to the hall; prepared the bath for him, and when he thought
to take good comfort, shaved him smooth and bald, and
packed him out of doors. Then would Count Hardman,
looking from the window, see with pleasure how the foxes’
whelps of children gathered from the hamlet to assail the
outcast, and to cry, as once their fellows to Elijah:</p>

<p>“‘Baldhead! Baldhead!’</p>

<p>“In this the scoffer took pleasure, laughing with a devilish
joy till he would hold his pot-paunch, and his eyes ran down
with water.</p>

<p>“Once came a saintly man from foreign lands; he carried,
like a penitent, a heavy cross upon his shoulder, and had
stamped five nail marks on his hands and feet and side; upon
his head there was a ring of hair like to the crown of thorns.
He called upon us here, requested water for his feet and a
small crust of bread. Immediately I took him to the bath to
serve him in my common way; respected not the sacred ring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
but shore it clean from off him. Then the pious pilgrim
spoke a heavy malison upon me: ‘Know, accursed man,
that when thou diest, heaven, and hell, and purgatory’s iron
gate are shut against thy soul. As goblin it shall rage within
these walls, till unrequired, unbid, a traveler come and exercise
retaliation on thee.’</p>

<p>“That hour I sickened, and the marrow in my bones dried
up; I faded like a shadow. My spirit left the wasted carcass,
and was exiled to this castle, as the saint had doomed it. In
vain I struggled for deliverance from the torturing bonds
that fettered me to earth; for thou must know that when the
soul forsakes her clay she panteth for her place of rest, and
this sick longing spins her years to aeons, while in foreign
elements she languishes for home. Now self-tormenting, I
pursued the mournful occupation I had followed in my lifetime.
Alas! my uproar soon made desolate this house. But
seldom came a pilgrim here to lodge. And though I treated
all like thee, no one would understand me, and perform, as
thou, the service which has freed my soul from bondage.
Henceforth shall no hobgoblin wander in this castle; I return
to my long-wished-for rest. And now, young stranger, once
again my thanks that thou hast loosed me! Were I keeper
of deep-hidden treasures, they were thine; but wealth in life
was not my lot, nor in this castle lies there any cash
entombed. Yet mark my counsel. Tarry here till beard and
locks again shall cover chin and scalp; then turn thee homeward
to thy native town; and on the Weser-bridge of
Bremen, at the time when day and night in autumn are alike,
wait for a friend who there will meet thee, who will tell thee
what to do, that it be well with thee on earth. If from the
golden horn of plenty blessing and abundance flow to thee,
then think of me; and ever as the day thou freedst me from
the curse comes round, cause for my soul’s repose three
masses to be said. Now fare thee well. I go, no more
returning.”</p>

<p>With these words the ghost, having by his copiousness of
talk satisfactorily attested his former existence as court-barber
in the castle of Rummelsburg, vanished into air, and
left his deliverer full of wonder at the strange adventure. He
stood for a long while motionless, in doubt whether the whole
matter had actually happened, or an unquiet dream had
deluded his senses; but his bald head convinced him that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
there had been a real occurrence. He returned to bed, and
slept, after the fright he had undergone, till the hour of
noon. The treacherous landlord had been watching since
morning, when the traveler with the scalp was to come forth,
that he might receive him with jibing speeches under pretext
of astonishment at his nocturnal adventure. But as the
stranger loitered too long, and midday was approaching,
the affair became serious; and mine host began to dread that
the goblin might have treated his guest a little harshly, have
beaten him to a jelly perhaps, or so frightened him that he
had died of terror; and to carry his wanton revenge to such
a length as this had not been his intention. He therefore
rung his people together, hastened out with man and maid to
the tower, and reached the door of the apartment where he
had observed the light on the previous evening. He found
an unknown key in the lock; but the door was barred within,
for after the disappearance of the goblin, Franz had again
secured it. He knocked with a perturbed violence, till the
Seven Sleepers themselves would have awoke at the din.
Franz started up, and thought in his first confusion that the
ghost was again standing at the door to favor him with
another call. But hearing mine host’s voice, who required
nothing more but that his guest would give some sign of life,
he gathered himself up and opened the door.</p>

<p>With seeming horror at the sight of him, mine host, striking
his hands together, exclaimed, “By heaven and all the
saints! Redcloak” (by this name the ghost was known
among them) “<em>has</em> been here, and has shaved you bald as a
block! Now, it is clear as day that the old story is no fable.
But tell me, how looked the goblin; what did he say to you?
what did he do?”</p>

<p>Franz, who had now seen through the questioner, made
answer: “The goblin looked like a man in a red cloak;
what he did is not hidden from you, and what he said I well
remember: ‘Stranger,’ said he, ‘trust no innkeeper who is a
Turk in grain. What would befall thee here he knew. Be wise
and happy. I withdraw from this my ancient dwelling,
for my time is run. Henceforth no goblin riots here; I now
become a silent incubus to plague the landlord; nip him,
tweak him, harrass him, unless the Turk do expiate his sin;
do freely give thee food and lodging till brown locks again
shall cluster round thy head.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
The landlord shuddered at these words, cut a large cross
in the air before him, vowed by the Holy Virgin to give the
traveler free board so long as he liked to continue, led him
over to his house and treated him with the best. By this
adventure Franz had well-nigh got the reputation of a conjurer,
as the spirit thenceforth never once showed face. He
often passed the night in the tower; and a desperado of the
village once kept him company, without having beard or
scalp disturbed. The owner of the place, having learned
that Redcloak no longer walked in Rummelsburg, was
delighted at the news, and ordered that the stranger, who,
as he supposed, had laid him, should be well taken care of.</p>

<p>By the time when the clusters were beginning to be colored
on the vine, and the advancing autumn reddened the apples,
Franz’s brown locks were again curling over his temples, and
he girded up his knapsack; for all thoughts and meditations
were turned upon the Weser-bridge, to seek the friend, who,
at the behest of the goblin barber, was to direct him how to
make his fortune. When about taking leave of mine host,
that charitable person led from his stable a horse well saddled
and equipped, which the owner of the castle had presented to
the stranger, for having made his house again habitable; nor
had the count forgot to send a sufficient purse along with it
to bear his traveling charges; and so Franz came riding
back into his native city, brisk and light of heart. He
sought out his old quarters, but kept himself quite retired,
only inquiring underhand how matters stood with the fair
Meta, whether she was still alive and unwedded. To this
inquiry he received a satisfactory answer, and contented himself
with it in the meanwhile; for, till his fate was decided,
he would not risk appearing in her sight, or making known
to her his arrival in Bremen.</p>

<p>With unspeakable longing he waited the equinox; his
impatience made every intervening day a year. At last the
long-wished-for term appeared. The night before he could
not close an eye for thinking of the wonders that were coming.
The blood was whirling and beating in his arteries, as
it had done at the Castle of Rummelsburg, when he lay in
expectation of his spectre visitant. To be sure of not missing
his expected friend, he rose by daybreak, and proceeded with
the earliest dawn to the Weser-bridge, which as yet stood
empty, and untrod by passengers. He walked along it several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
times in solitude, with that presentiment of coming gladness
which includes in it the real enjoyment of all terrestrial
felicity; for it is not the attainment of our wishes, but the
undoubted hope of attaining them, which offers to the human
soul the full measure of highest and most heartfelt satisfaction.
He formed many projects as to how he should present
himself to his beloved Meta, when his looked-for happiness
should have arrived; whether it would be better to appear
before her in full splendor, or to mount from his former darkness
with the first gleam of morning radiance, and discover
to her by degrees the change in his condition. Curiosity,
moreover, put a thousand questions to Reason in regard to
the adventure. Who can the friend be that is to meet me on
the Weser-bridge? Will it be one of my old acquaintances,
by whom, since my ruin, I have been entirely forgotten?
How will he pave the way to me for happiness? And will
this way be short or long, easy or toilsome? To the whole of
which Reason, in spite of her thinking, answered not a word.</p>

<p>In about an hour the bridge began to get awake; there
was riding, driving, walking to and fro on it, and much commercial
ware passing this way and that. The usual dayguard
of beggars and importunate persons also by degrees took up
this post, so favorable for their trade, to levy contributions
on the public benevolence; for of poorhouses and workhouses
the wisdom of legislators had as yet formed no
scheme. The first of the tattered cohort that applied for
alms to the jovial promenader, from whose eyes gay hope
laughed forth, was a discharged soldier, provided with the
military badge of a timber leg, which had been lent him, seeing
he had fought so stoutly in former days for his native
country, as the recompense of his valor, with the privilege of
begging where he pleased; and who now, in the capacity of
physiognomist, pursued the study of man upon the Weser-bridge,
with such success, that he very seldom failed in his
attempts for charity. Nor did his exploratory glance mislead
him in the present instance; for Franz, in the joy of his
heart, threw a white engelgroshen into the cripple’s hat.</p>

<p>During the morning hours, when none but the laborious
artisan is busy, and the more exalted townsmen still lie in
sluggish rest, he scarcely looked for his promised friend; he
expected him in the higher classes, and took little notice of
the present passengers. About the council-hour, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
when the proceres of Bremen were driving past to the hall,
in their gorgeous robes of office, and about exchange time,
he was all eye and ear; he spied the passengers from afar,
and when a right man came along the bridge his blood began
to flutter, and he thought here was the creator of his fortune.
Meanwhile hour after hour passed on; the sun rose high;
ere long the noontide brought a pause in business; the rushing
crowd faded away, and still the expected friend appeared
not. Franz now walked up and down the bridge quite alone;
had no society in view but the beggars, who were serving
out their cold collations without moving from the place. He
made no scruple to do the same; purchased some fruit, and
took his dinner <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">inter ambulandum</i>.</p>

<p>The whole club that was dining on the Weser-bridge had
remarked the young man watching here from early morning
till noon, without addressing any one or doing any sort of
business. They held him to be a lounger; and though all
of them had tasted his bounty, he did not escape their critical
remarks. In jest they had named him the bridge-bailiff.
The physiognomist with the timber-toe, however, noticed that
his countenance was not now so gay as in the morning; he
appeared to be reflecting earnestly on something; he had
drawn his hat close over his face; his movement was slow
and thoughtful; he had nibbled at an apple rind for some
time, without seeming to be conscious that he was doing so.
From this appearance of affairs the man-spier thought he
might extract some profit; therefore he put his wooden and
his living leg in motion, and stilted off to the other end of
the bridge, and lay in wait for the thinker, that he might
assail him, under the appearance of a new arrival, for a fresh
alms. This invention prospered to the full; the musing
philosopher gave no heed to the mendicant, put his hand into
his pocket mechanically, and threw a six-groat piece into the
fellow’s hat, to be rid of him.</p>

<p>In the afternoon a thousand new faces once more came
abroad. The watcher was now tired of his unknown friend’s
delaying, yet hope still kept his attention on the stretch. He
stepped into the view of every passenger, hoped that one of
them would clasp him in his arms; but all proceeded coldly
on their way, the most did not observe him at all, and few
returned his salute with a slight nod. The sun was already
verging to decline, the shadows were becoming longer, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
crowd upon the bridge diminished; and the beggar-brigade
by degrees drew back into their barracks in the Mattenburg.
A deep sadness sank upon the hopeless Franz when he saw
his expectation mocked, and the lordly prospect which had
lain before him in the morning vanish from his eyes at evening.
He fell into a sort of sulky desperation; was on the
point of springing over the parapet, and dashing himself
down from the bridge into the river. But the thought of
Meta kept him back, and induced him to postpone his purpose
till he had seen her yet once more. He resolved to
watch her next day when she should go to church, for the
last time to drink delight from her looks, and then forthwith
to still his warm love forever in the cold stream of the Weser.</p>

<p>While about to leave the bridge he was met by the invalided
pikeman with the wooden leg, who, for pastime, had been
making many speculations as to what could be the young
man’s object, that had made him watch upon the bridge from
dawn to darkness. He himself had lingered beyond his usual
time, that he might wait him out; but as the matter hung
too long upon the pegs, curiosity incited him to turn to the
youth himself, and question him respecting it.</p>

<p>“No offence, young gentleman,” said he, “allow me to
ask you a question.”</p>

<p>Franz, who was not in a talking humor, and was meeting,
from the mouth of a cripple, the address which he had looked
for with such longing from a friend, answered rather testily,
“Well, then, what is it? Speak, old graybeard.”</p>

<p>“We two,” said the other, “were the first upon the bridge
to-day, and now, you see, we are the last. As to me and
others of my kidney, it is our vocation brings us hither, our
trade of alms-gathering; but for you, in sooth you are not of
our guild; yet you have watched here the whole blessed
day. Now I pray you, tell me, if it is not a secret, what is it
that brings you hither, or what stone is lying on your heart.”</p>

<p>“What good were it to thee, old blade,” said Franz, bitterly,
“to know where the shoe pinches me, or what concern
is lying on my heart? It will give thee small care.”</p>

<p>“Sir, I have a kind wish toward you, because you opened
your hand and gave me alms; but your countenance at night is
not so cheerful as in the morning, and that grieves my heart.”</p>

<p>The kindly sympathy of this old warrior pleased the misanthrope,
so that he willingly pursued the conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
“Why, then,” answered he, “if thou wouldst know what
has made me battle here all day with tedium, thou must
understand that I was waiting for a friend, who appointed
me hither, and now leaves me to expect in vain.”</p>

<p>“Under favor,” answered Timbertoe, “if I might speak
my mind, this friend of yours, be he who he like, is little
better than a rogue, to lead you such a dance. If he treated
<em>me</em> so, by my faith, his crown should get acquainted with my
crutch next time we met. If he could not keep his word he
should have let you know, and not thus bamboozle you as
if you were a child.”</p>

<p>“Yet I cannot altogether blame this friend,” said Franz,
“for being absent; he did not promise; it was but a dream
that told me I should meet him here.”</p>

<p>The goblin tale was too long for him to tell, so he veiled
it under cover of a dream.</p>

<p>“Ah! that is another story,” said the beggar; “if you
build on dreams it is little wonder that your hope deceives
you. I myself have dreamed much foolish stuff in my time,
but I was never such a madman as to heed it. Had I all the
treasures that have been allotted to me in dreams, I might buy
the city of Bremen, were it sold by auction. But I never
credited a jot of them, or stirred hand or foot to prove their
worth or worthlessness. I knew well it would be lost. Ha!
I must really laugh in your face, to think that, on the order
of an empty dream, you have squandered a fair day of your
life, which you might have spent better at a merry banquet.”</p>

<p>“The issue shows that thou art right, old man, and that
dreams many times deceive. But,” continued Franz, defensively,
“I dreamed so vividly and circumstantially, above
three months ago, that on this very day, in this very place, I
should meet a friend, who would tell me things of the deepest
importance, that it was well worth while to come and see if
it would come to pass.”</p>

<p>“O, as for vividness,” said Timbertoe, “no man can dream
more vividly than I. There is one dream I had, which I shall
never in my life forget. I dreamed, who knows how many
years ago, that my guardian angel stood before my bed in
the figure of a youth, with golden hair, and two silver wings
on his back, and said to me: ‘Berthold, listen to the words
of my mouth, that none of them be lost from thy heart.
There is a treasure appointed thee which thou shalt dig, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
comfort thy heart withal for the remaining days of thy life.
To-morrow, about evening, when the sun is going down, take
spade and shovel upon thy shoulder; go forth from the
Mattenburg on the right, across the Tieber, by the Balkenbrücke,
past the cloister of St. John’s, and on to the Great
Roland. Then take thy way over the court of the cathedral,
through the Schüsselkorb, till thou arrive without the city at
a garden, which has this mark, that a stair of three stone
steps leads down from the highway to its gate. Wait by a
side, in secret, till the sickle of the moon shall shine on thee,
then push with the strength of a man against the weak-barred
gate, which will resist thee little. Enter boldly into the
garden, and turn thee to the vine trellises which overhang
the covered walk; behind this, on the left, a tall apple tree
overtops the lowly shrubs. Go to the trunk of this tree, thy
face turned right against the moon; look three ells before
thee on the ground, thou shalt see two cinnamon rose bushes;
there strike in and dig three spans deep, till thou find a stone
plate; under this lies the treasure, buried in an iron chest,
full of money and money’s worth. Though the chest be
heavy and clumsy, avoid not the labor of lifting it from its
bed; it will reward thy trouble well, if thou seek the key
which lies hid beneath it.’”</p>

<p>In astonishment at what he heard, Franz stared and gazed
upon the dreamer, and could not have concealed his amazement
had not the dusk of night been on his side. By every
mark in the description he had recognized his own garden,
left him by his father, and which in the days of his extravagance,
he had sold for an old song.</p>

<p>To Franz the pikeman had at once become extremely
interesting, as he perceived that this was the very friend to
whom the goblin in the castle of Rummelsburg had consigned
him. Gladly could he have embraced the veteran, and in the
first rapture called him friend and father; but he restrained
himself, and found it more advisable to keep his thoughts
about this piece of news to himself. So he said, “Well, this
is what I call a circumstantial dream. But what didst thou
do, old master, in the morning, on awakening? Didst thou
not follow whither thy guardian angel beckoned thee?”</p>

<p>“Pooh,” said the dreamer, “why should I toil, and have
my labor for my pain? It was nothing, after all, but a mere
dream. My guardian angel takes little charge of me, I think,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
else I should not, to his shame, be going hitching about here
on a wooden leg.”</p>

<p>Franz took out the last piece of silver he had on him:
“There,” said he, “old father, take this other gift from me,
to get thee a pint of wine for evening-cup; thy talk has
driven away my ill humor. Neglect not diligently to frequent
this bridge; we shall see each other here, I hope, again.”</p>

<p>The lame old man had not gathered so rich a stock of alms
for many a day as he was now possessed off; he blessed his
benefactor for his kindness, hopped away into a drinking
shop to do himself a good turn; while Franz, enlivened with
new hope, hastened off to his lodging in the alley.</p>

<p>Next day he got in readiness everything that is required
for treasure-digging. The unessential equipments, conjurations,
magic formulas, magic girdles, hieroglyphic characters,
and such like, were entirely wanting; but these are not indispensable,
provided there be no failure in the three main
requisites—shovel, spade, and, before all, a treasure underground.
The necessary implements he carried to the place a
little before sunset, and hid them for the meanwhile in a
hedge; and as to the treasure itself, he had the firm conviction
that the goblin in the castle and the friend on the bridge
would prove no liars to him. With longing impatience he
expected the rising of the moon, and no sooner did she stretch
her silver horns over the bushes than he briskly set to work,
observing exactly everything the old man had taught him;
and happily raised the treasure without meeting any adventure
in the process, without any black dog having frightened
him, or any bluish flame having lighted him to the spot.</p>

<p>Father Melchior, in burying this penny for a rainy day,
had nowise meant that his son should be deprived of so considerable
part of his inheritance. The mistake lay in this,
that death had escorted the testator out of the world in
another way than said testator had expected. He had been
completely convinced that he should take his journey, old and
full of days, after regulating his temporal concerns with all
the formalities of an ordinary sick-bed; for so it had been
prophesied to him in his youth. In consequence he purposed,
when, according to the usage of the church, extreme unction
should have been dispensed to him, to call his beloved son to
his bedside, having previously dismissed all bystanders, there
to give him the paternal blessing, and by way of farewell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
memorial direct him to this treasure buried in the garden.
All this, too, would have happened in just order, if the light
of the old man had departed like that of a wick whose oil is
done; but as death had privily snuffed him out at a feast, he
undesignedly took along with him his secret to the grave.</p>

<p>With immeasurable joy the treasure-digger took possession
of the shapeless Spanish pieces, which, with a vast multitude
of other finer coins the old chest had faithfully preserved.
When the first intoxication of delight had in some degree
evaporated, he bethought him how the treasure was to be
transported, safe and unobserved into the narrow alley. The
burden was too heavy to be carried without help; thus, with
the possession of riches, all the cares attendant on them were
awakened. The new Crœsus found no better plan than to
intrust his capital to the hollow trunk of a tree that stood
behind the garden, in a meadow; the empty chest he again
buried under the rose-bush, and smoothed the place as well
as possible. In the space of three days the treasure had been
faithfully transmitted by instalments from the hollow tree
into the narrow alley; and now the owner of it thought he
might with honor lay aside his strict incognito. He dressed
himself with the finest; had his prayer displaced from the
church, and required, instead of it, “A Christian thanksgiving
for a traveler on returning to his native town, after happily
arranging his affairs.” He hid himself in a corner of the
church, where he could observe the fair Meta, without himself
being seen; he turned not his eye from the maiden, and
drank from her looks the actual rapture which in foretaste had
restrained him from suicide on the bridge of the Weser. When
the thanksgiving came in hand, a glad sympathy shone from
all her features and the cheeks of the virgin glowed with joy.</p>

<p>Franz now appeared once more on the Exchange; began a
branch of trade which in a few weeks extended to a great
scale; and as his wealth became daily more apparent, Neighbor
Grudge, the scandal-chewer, was obliged to conclude,
that in the cashing of his old debts he must have had more
luck than sense. He hired a large house, fronting the Roland,
in the market-place; engaged clerks and warehousemen;
carried on his trade unweariedly; married Meta; provided
for old Timbertoe; lived happily with his wife; and found the
most tolerable mother-in-law that has ever been discovered.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
